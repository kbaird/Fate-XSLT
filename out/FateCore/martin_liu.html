    2035: Tír Tairngire secedes from SSC; CFS kicked out of UCAS
    2036: TT invades northern CFS to Redding
    2041-2044: Nationalist War in China
    2042: Liu's parents emigrate from Beijing to TT
    2046-05-08 17:15:12 -0700: Liu born in Cara'Sir (Portland), TT
    Both parents are 1st Generation Han Chinese Elves who emigrated from
    greater Beijing to Tír Tairngire, motivated by the welcoming-to-metahumans
    rhetoric of TT's founding and the unrest in China at that time.

    Under Tír Tairngire's autocratic government, Martin was a member of the
    Rinelle ke'Tesrae's moderate/liberal wing, favoring democratic elections
    and a reduction/elimination of the formal caste system. Since the elections
    of 2065, he eschews revolutionary action in favor of "within the system"
    reforms. He has no particular admiration for the previous unelected
    Princes, and adheres to no significant racism directed at either metatypes
    or ethnic backgrounds, thereby opposing the Elf supremacist factions in the
    Rinelle [LOP7-8/SofNA142-3]. His family spoke mainly 普通话 at home. His
    true native language is now Sperethiel, and he has a strong non-native
    command of English.

    2064: Liu undergoes Rite of Passage [TT57]. For the Bridging portion, he
    went to Anthony Lakes, Whitman National Forest in Northeastern Tír
    Tairngire. Tír Tairngirenes can be issued their standard Peace Force
    survival knife before deferred military service so they can use it in the
    Bridging, as Liu did. For the Naming portion, he chose to replace his birth
    name Resperentish with Imiritish ke'Tolosa, and made appropriate democratic
    reforms to the usual declarations of loyalty, cf. Reconstructionist Judaic
    bar mitzvah.
    2065: 1st open TT elections, Larry Zincan elected High Prince. Liu voted for him.
    2067: PCC absorbs Ute nation w/much Ute unrest
    2068: Martin gets B.A. in Applied Thaumaturgy from UTT in Serentaneyo
    (Eugene), starts mandatory 2-year military service in Border Patrol. Liu
    served as a Lt. in the Border Patrol due to his parents being Chivalry rank
    [TT59].

    2070: 2nd open TT elections, Zincan re-elected. Liu votes for him as High
    Prince again. Of the other Princes, he has spoken most approvingly of Jake
    Foster &amp; Amy Joubert [LOP14], with some support as well for Conall
    Taylor [LOP15]. 4th Rite of Progression held, Liu does not participate due
    to extended wilderness/border assignments for his military service, which
    he completes later that year.
    
    2072: M.A. in Applied Thaumaturgy from UTT in Serentaneyo (Eugene); Liu
    moves to Tarislar, Puyallup [Seattle126]. Lives a Low lifestyle near the
    hospital Deireadh an Tuartheil, "The End of the Song of the People/Tribe"
    [Seattle128, SS:HSLL12-13], where he volunteers with Health spells.

    Spellcaster notes:
    (TBD: specific small set of spells, like Fate in Freeport? Drain? Can't
    repeat same spell in the same scene? Or get a Mental Stress if you do?) I
    figure a pretty loose definition of the stunt is OK, since it requires a
    completely new skill, burns a stunt in addition to the required Magician
    extra, AND requires in-game narrative justification from the player.
    Alternatively, we could define the 五行 tradition as a character via the
    Fate Fractal.
    Spirit Summoner notes:
    Can petition the Celestial Bureaucracy for magical favors
    (Keep consistent with SR rules, or make up some narratively rich alternative?)
    Similar pragmatic limits to Spellcaster, especially if it's kept close to
    SR spirit types &amp; powers.
