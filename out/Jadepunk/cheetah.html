Min was one of the all time great relic hunters. She had robbed dozens of tombs on four
continents. Until she was betrayed. One of her rivals spread the word of a great lost city,
deep in the jungle south of Ahlmac territory. There were claims of Ruby Skulls and pyramids
of gold. The rival, Tobias Schmidt, did not spread these rumors for Min's benefit, no. He
spread them in the court of her largest patron, Inoue Shen. Shen ignored Min's warnings that
this was a trap and sent her to gather these riches.

In the harshest jungle, far from civilization, walking into what she knew to be a trap, Min
made a mistake. She dropped her compass. Of such small mistakes, mighty catastrophes grow.
This was one such mistake. Unable to make an accurate bearing she was forced to use the sun
and stars. In the deepest jungle, she got turned around, she became lost. Wandering for days
without proper supplies, she was becoming dehydrated and delirious. In this state she came
upon an ancient Teltac temple to Cicoh Chac, god of the Divine Wind and blood sacrifice.

Within the temple she drank of the holy waters and ate of the sacred mushroom. While in an
ecstatic state, brought about by her exhaustion and the mushrooms, she had a great vision of
the god Cicoh Chac. It came to her in the form of Spotted Panther and spoke of many things.
Dark secrets were revealed to Min and she accepted a great burden. She would become Cicoh
Chac's will made manifest. She donned the sacred garb of the Teltac Warrior Priests and set
out to find a new empire for her dark master.

In Kausao City the people will listen to anyone who gives them hope. Min has done more than
that, she has given them a twisted sense of power. She leads a small cult of the
underclasses, they feed her information and when the need strikes they bring to her a blood
sacrifice. Within her small district she has built a kingdom of blood. Right now it is
beneath the notice of those in power. On the day they do take notice, pray that it is not to
late. Min dreams of a city awash in blood and fear. She dreams of a burning empire from
horizon to horizon.

    The ancient Teltac high priests had cloaks made from the skins of the holy panthers, they
    would thread blue and white jade into the cloaks to aid in speed and stealth. This cloak is
    one of the last in existence, and makes Min the fastest biped on the planet.
