Baatarsai was born to the owner of one of the finest Jadetech Engineering firms in all of
Kausao, Wei-Tech Industrial. Over ten percent of all jade in the city was smelted in their
Refineries, and Wei-Tech innovations were used in all forms of Jadetech. Life was good for the
child Baatarsai, until that fateful night. On their way home from the opera his mother and
father were robbed and killed in front of his very eyes. On that day he swore an oath to put a
stop to all crime, so that no one else would ever need go through the pain he had just
suffered.

Trained from an early age by Peng An in several forms of martial arts, Baatarsai has developed

to take his opponents out with minimal danger. As a master of the Way of the Bat, Baatarsai can
read his opponents like a book and react with near superhuman speed to their actions.

A former master of the martial arts, An gave up fighting to become a man of peace. After the
death of his master, he sought to help you Baatarsai deal with his pain through the only
thing An knew might help. He trained the lad in every form of martial arts he knew. Never had
An seen a more gifted or dedicated pupil. Now he is old and he looks at Baatarsai's life's
work with no small amount of pride. Though he doesn't say, Baatarsai loves his mentor, and
fears for his safety now that the great work has begun.
