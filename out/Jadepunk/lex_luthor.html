<legend class="label"><span>Story</span></legend>
The world is full of fools. Fools with power and fools without it. This is the sad truth that
Luthor has had to endure her entire life. She may be the greatest mind humanity has ever
produced. She should rule it, control it. Who else is better qualified? Yet at every step some
fool comes along and blocks her success. First it was money, so she became chief engineer for
the king. Then it was authority, and she was forced to deal with the simpleton Xiao. Now she is
nearing her goal. Complete domination is within her grasp, if only Xiao would cease with his
petty paranoias and conspiracies. There will come a day when he is no longer useful to her.
Perhaps that day is nearer than she initially projected. Soon all the world will be brilliantly
efficient and simple. No longer will the simpletons and fools who lucked into power run things
like their own personal play ground. Soon.

  Truly there is no finer mind for invention of planning than the mind of Alexis Luthor. She has
  litle patience for using old plans of devices. Everything she comes up with is an inovation.
  None can accuse Luthor of copying or tinkering. She is a genius.

  She has already won. You don't realize it, because your simple mind can only plan four or
  maybe five moves ahead. You only think you are winning because she is so far ahead of you
  that she is lapping you. When she needs to Luthor can utilize her magnificent mind to deal
  with any situation she can plan for.
