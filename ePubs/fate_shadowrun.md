Fate Shadowrun
==============

Extra: Magician
---------------

(cf.
 [Collegia Arcane](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/creating-extra#strong-extra-collegia-arcana-magic-strong))

-   **Permissions**: One Aspect establishing that the character is Awakened.
-   **Costs**: Skill ranks in the new **Spellcasting** and **Conjuring** Skills.

(For **Conjuring**, see
 [Storm Summoners](http://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/storm-summoners#the-30-second-version))

### Actions:

-   **Overcome**:
Use **Spellcasting** to remove Aspects, whether through modifying the physical environment
  directly or dispelling sustained magical effects. The initial caster of a sustained effect can
  defend against dispelling with **Spellcasting**. Use **Lore** for knowledge of magical topics.

-   **Create an Advantage**:
Use **Spellcasting** to alter the environment with magic or place
  mental and physical impediments on a target, such as _Slowed Movement_ or _A Foggy Head_.
  Characters can defend against this with **Will**. The **Magician** Extra also justifies
  observation by means of Astral Perception.

-   **Attack**:
Use **Spellcasting** to directly harm someone with Magic. Targets can defend with
  **Athletics** or **Will** depending on the nature of the attack, or **Spellcasting** if they
  are also magically active.

-   **Defend**:
Use **Spellcasting** to defend against hostile magical attacks or dispelling attempts.

### Stunts:
-   **Quick Summoner**:
Allows **Conjuring** to no longer be a "slow practice" or require a summoning circle. (Models
  Shamanic Conjuring from 1st Ed Shadowrun, as distinct from Hermetic, which follows the Storm
  Summoners model fairly well already).

### Drain:
-   Use the **Extra Effort** option for [Stress](http://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/customized-tools#stress)
-   Use the **Extreme Effort** option for
[Consequences](http://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/consequences#alternate-uses-for-consequences)
