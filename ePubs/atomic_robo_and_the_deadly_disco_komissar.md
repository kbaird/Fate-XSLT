# Atomic Robo and The Deadly Disco Komissar

## Pressures/Game Aspects:
  * **Tesladyne**'s _Remain Calm and Trust in Science_
  * _The Bronze Age of Comics_
  * _The Honky Capitalist Pig Establishment_
  * _Cold War Tensions_
  * _The Freedom to Do What?_
  * _Get Down Tonight_

### Notes

The summer of 1978 allows Robo to have returned to Earth from Mars, and for Neil deGrasse Tyson
to be home in NYC from his undergraduate studies at Harvard University.

## Scene 0: Hayden Planetarium

In the summer of 1978, [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) has been invited
to give a talk at the [Hayden Planetarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Planetarium) on the
[_Physiologoi_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_School_\(philosophy\))
("Those who discoursed on nature") of Miletus, Ionia in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.
(Given the time period, it's likely that the material will be a partial preview what will soon be
found in the book and TV editions of the Robo Universe's version of
[_Cosmos_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage).) 
Sagan invites both Robo and
[Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) to attend.
As Sparrow II happens to be visiting Robo at the time, and has _A Keen And Inquisitive Mind_,
she accompanies Robo as well.

## Scene 1: Empire State Building

After the talk, Robo invites Carl, Neil, and Sparrow on a tour of Tesladyne's facilities at the
[Empire State Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building).  While there, the
offices are attacked by bog-standard **vampires**. Robo is surprised, because their vampire dimension
security was tightened after a breach in 1965.

Treat as a **Challenge** (ARRPG pg 106), each of

- **Combat**
- **Athletics**
- **Engineering**

vs. **Fantastic (+6)**.

### Vampires (Nameless NPCs, ARRPG pg 291, mobs of 5)

**Modes and Skills**
: **_Fair (+2) Vampire_** (+3 Combat, Physique; +2 Athletics, Notice)

**Aspects**
: _Ageless Super-Strong Monster_, _Insatiable Hunger for Living Flesh_

**Stress**
: [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]

Teamwork Bonus (ARRPG172: +1 per extra member of the mob, so starting at +4)

#### Who's To Blame?

Unless **Brainstorming** declares differently, the team should uncover data suggesting that _someone_
has sabotaged Tesladyne's security in an attempt to discredit **_The Honky Capitalist Pig
Establishment_** and optimistic scientific worldviews in general (which Tesladyne represents, and
which support the US' technological base).

Evidence points to **_Capricorn Rising_**, a discotheque in the
[Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan) neighborhood in Manhattan, an
astrologically-inclined parody of [_Studio 54_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54) in
[Hell's Kitchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan).

## Scene 2: Capricorn Rising

Treat as 2 **Contests** (ARRPG pg110): **_Get Into the Exclusive Club_**, **_Get Past Crowd/Goons_**

## Scene 3: Private Offices

Between the cocaine and loud dance music, the team should be able to make their way into the private
offices upstairs to confront the **_Deadly Disco Komissar_** and the **_Kung Fu Trucker_**.

### Soviet Goons (Nameless NPCs, mobs of 5)

**Modes and Skills**
: **_Fair (+2) Action_**

**Aspects**
: _We Fight As One_, _Death to America!_

**Stress**
: [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]  [ 1 ]

Teamwork Bonus (ARRPG172: +1 per extra member of the mob, so starting at +4)

## Scene 4 (optional): Big Rig Chase on Riverside Drive

Presumably a **Contest** vs. the **_Kung Fu Trucker_**, both using **Vehicles**.
