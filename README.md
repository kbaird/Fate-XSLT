# Fate-XSLT

Character [DTD](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/dtds.html)s for various [Fate](http://www.faterpg.com/)-based
games, along with [XSLT](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt) sheets for rendering to HTML (and potentially other formats).

## Supported Systems

[Fate Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/) |
[Fate Accelerated](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fae/) (FAE) |
[Atomic Robo](http://www.evilhat.com/home/atomic-robo/) |
[Spirit of the Century](http://www.evilhat.com/home/spirit-of-the-century-2/) from 
[Evil Hat Productions](http://evilhat.com/)

[VSCA Publishing](http://vsca.ca/)

[Jadepunk](http://jadepunk.com/) from [Reroll Productions](http://rerollproductions.com/?project=jadepunk)

## Usage

Store character files in the `characters` directory, and execute via

    ./publish.sh some_path_to_a_character_file.xml

which depends on a default XSL stylesheet being defined in the given XML document.
The sample characters demonstrate this.

Output (currently just HTML) is rendered into the `out` directory, preserving any
subdirectories.

Validation is also available:

    ./validate.sh some_file.dtd some_character_file.xml other_character_file.xml

Various rule variants are supported, via boolean attributes of the <hacks> element.
Currently supported variants include

### Miscellanea
I develop on an Ubuntu 14.04 system with `xmllint` and `xsltproc` executables
available. Those assumptions are reflected in the stock versions of the publish
executables for now.
