      A holographic projection of the perfect ideal of a Mesoamerican plumed serpent.
      Unsatisfied by their Gods' continued silence, the Tenochca took matters into their own hands.

  <stunts>
    <stunt mega="true" name="Incorporeal">
      You can move through solid objects with ease. Ignore physical obstacles. Under
      normal circumstances, you are also immune to all physical harm. It’s like the Bulletproof
      benefit, but much more all-encompassing. However, while in this state, you can’t interact
      with the physical world in any way. In addition, a combination of the proper equipment,
      the right conditions, and a precise command sequence on the hosting computer system
      (in other words, a compel on Divine Simulation) can force you
      into a corporeal state. This causes you to lose the benefits of this stunt and the use of the
      Hover skill until the end of the scene, at which time you revert to incorporeality again.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Fade Away">
      While incorporeal, you can choose to disappear—leave a scene—anytime. Spend a fate point to come back.
    </stunt>
    <!--
    <stunt name="Rocket Launchers &amp; Coughed Up Lugers">Weapon 2</stunt>
    <stunt mega="true" name="Wake of Destruction">
      When you succeed with style on a Tooth and Claw attack, spend a Fate Point to also inflict a Collateral
      Consequence (of the lowest available severity) in addition to any other stress or consequences the target has taken.
