    <description>
Daughter of Sparrow I, one of the few Sparrows to inherit the role while the
previous Sparrow was still able-bodied, and the first Sparrow to benefit from
the larger intelligence capability of Section 13. Sparrow II first encountered
Atomic Robo while attempting to thwart Dr. Vanadis Valkyrieâ€™s plot to begin
World War 3 in 1968. She retired to head of Section 13 in 1995.

    <stunt name="Judo Black Belt">
      When defending with Combat, on a success with style you may spend a fate point to deal a
      3-shift physical hit to the attacker (instead of getting a boost).
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Sword Umbrella" mega="true">
      You often carry an umbrella that secretly serves as a sheath for a hidden and slender
      sword blade. It's the 60s; none of this is quite as ridiculous as it sounds. The sword
      has Weapon:2
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Beauty And The Blade">
      +2 to attack or create an advantage with Combat when wielding a sword.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Wreckless Driver">
      Once per scene, when driving a car, you can reduce the harm dealt by an attack by up to 4
      shifts by letting the attacker have a situation aspect with one free invocation.
