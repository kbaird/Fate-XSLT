    <description>
Dr. Sagan's early work in astrophysics and the origins of life on Earth naturally led to
investigating the possibility of life on other planets...
Dr. Sagan contributed to many of NASA's robotic exploratory missions. He was perhaps best known
for his efforts to popularize scientific interests and pursuits through mass media.

    <stunt name="We Are Made Of Starstuff">
      You are a compelling speaker, and may use Cosmology to create an advantage in social situations if you can make it about science somehow.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="People Are Not Stupid">
      +2 to overcome with Rapport when persuading someone in a way that respects their beliefs.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Confirmed Skeptic">
      Use Will to see through a lie with a logical or scientific basis.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Friends in High Places: ☐">
      Once per issue, when you have the time and opportunity to meet with your contacts in the
      scientific community, you can spend a fate point to acquire a cutting-edge or top-notch
      piece of technology. Once per volume, if done as part of creating an invention (page
      139), this can satisfy a serious catch.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="A Few Minor Adjustments">
      Given almost enough time and serviceable tools, you can replace one (and only one) of a
      hardware's stunts or mega-stunts with another of your choosing.  If this adds more stunt
      benefits than it had before you messed with it, each additional one costs a fate point.
      The new stunt or mega-stunt lasts until the end of the issue, then vanishes.
