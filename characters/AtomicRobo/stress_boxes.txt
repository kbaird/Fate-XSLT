Modes with Athletics or Physique can give your character additional physical
stress boxes, while modes with Provoke or Will can give your character
additional mental stress boxes. A mode with one or more of these skills rated
at Fair (+2) adds one box, while one rated at Good (+3) adds two boxes.

If a mode has skills that apply to both types, the bonus boxes can apply to
either one. For example, the Action mode has Athletics, Physique, and Provoke.
If you've given it a rating of Good (+3), you could have two more physical
stress boxes, two more mental stress boxes, or one in each.

Bonus stress boxes from your Good (+3) and Fair (+2) modes are cumulative. So
if you have Good (+3) Action and Fair (+2) Intrigue, both of which have the
  Athletics skill, you can get three more physical stress boxesâ€”two from Action
  and one from Intrigue.
