    <description>
A member of the American Interplanetary Society and the Institute for Advanced
Study, Ira was one of the top "rocket men" in the United States at the onset of
World War II. During the war, he maintained artillery tables and bomb sights as
close to the front lines as possible to minimize equipment downtime. As the
furthest-deployed Allied rocket scientist, Ira was selected to join Atomic
Robo’s vanguard unit of Operation Paperclip. Ira would later join Robo as one
of the original Science Agents of Tesladyne. His knowledge of advanced
propulsion systems would prove to be invaluable in the aerospace firm’s early
years.
