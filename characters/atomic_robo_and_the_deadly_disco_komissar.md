# Atomic Robo and The Deadly Disco Komissar

## Pressures/Game Aspects:
  * **The Freedom to Do What?**
  * **The Honky Capitalist Pig Establishment**
  * _Tesladyne_'s **Remain Calm and Trust in Science**

In the summer of 1978, [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) has been invited
to give a talk at the [Hayden Planetarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Planetarium) on the
[_Physiologoi_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_School_\(philosophy\))
("Those who discoursed on nature") of Miletus, Ionia in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.
(Given the time period, it's likely that the material will be a partial preview what will soon be
found in the book and TV editions of the Robo Universe's version of
[_Cosmos_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage).) 
Sagan invites both Robo and
[Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) to attend.
As Sparrow II happens to be visiting Robo at the time, and has _A Keen And Inquisitive Mind_,
she accompanies Robo as well.

After the talk, Robo invites Carl, Neil, and Sparrow on a tour of Tesladyne's facilities at the
[Empire State Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building).  While there, the
offices are attacked by bog-standard vampires. Robo is surprised, because their vampire dimension
security was tightened after a breach in 1965.

Unless brainstorming declares differently, the team should uncover data suggesting that _someone_
has sabotaged Tesladyne's security in an attempt to discredit **The Honky Capitalist Pig
Establishment** and optimistic scientific worldviews in general (which Tesladyne represents, and
which support the US' technological base).

Evidence points to _Capricorn Rising_, a discotheque in the
[Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan) neighborhood in Manhattan, an
astrologically-inclined parody of [_Studio 54_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54) in
[Hell's Kitchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan). Between the cocaine and
loud dance music, the team should be able to make their way into the private offices upstairs to
confront the _Deadly Disco Komissar_ and the _Kung Fu Trucker_.

### Notes

The summer of 1978 allows Robo to have returned to Earth from Mars, and for Neil deGrasse Tyson
to be home in NYC from his undergraduate studies at Harvard University.
