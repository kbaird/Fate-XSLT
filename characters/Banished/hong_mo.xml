    <gadget cost="1" name="Ghost Monkey 武術" notes="Clever, Sneaky:
Ghost Monkey concentrates on the mastery of internal energies to augment the style's acrobatic
defenses and attacks. Pushes, feints, sweeps, and pressure point strikes hinder an attacker, making him
easier to outmaneuver and subdue. Rolls and dodges keep opponents at a distance until the practitioner
can find the right opening to finish the fight with a disabling strike or grapple. One of the most physical of
the Ghost styles, many underestimate the inner power of the capering, mocking Ghost Monkey.">

        <benefit name="Ghost Haunts the Shadow">
          You may use Clever instead of Sneaky to Create an Advantage based on stealth or concealment. If
          Sneaky is greater or equal to a character's Clever approach, gain a +2 bonus to such rolls instead.
