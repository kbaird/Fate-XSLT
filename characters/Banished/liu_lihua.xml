    <playername>Jenn Cornish</playername>
    <description>
      Often appears in the form of a statuette of her living form.
      When she manifests in human form, is obviously a ghost (like
      Cordie's apartment's former owner). Moves Harryhausen-style.

      Middle-class 3rd wife, married up.
      Killed by her mother-in-law, Madam 刘/Liú,
      who wanted her son to have a better 3rd wife.
      Madam 刘/Liú pushed her off a cliff, and the statue was fashioned
      out of the rock onto which 丽华/LíHuá was impaled.

      Madam 刘/Liú's grandchildren gave the statue to
      Fungible 周/Zhōu in lieu of back taxes.

      notes="Earth sorcery is tied not just to rock and stone but to the hidden
      places of the earth. Powerful practitioners of this style of magic can
      even become as stone to resist damage and weather overwhelming force,
      but they lack the flexibility of storm or flash of fire sorcery.

      Basic Powers: Earth-bonded are able to find hidden truths—they often say,
      “The ground cannot lie.” So long as an earth sorcerer touches the earth,
      she has an innate sense of everything else connected to the ground:
      where people are, which crates are empty and which conceal something
      heavy, structural supports and faults in a building, and so forth.
      This lets the character use Careful/Clever to find clues others could not.
      The sorcerer does not know who is standing behind a door or the title and
      contents of a book hidden in a locked desk, but she knows that those things
      are there.">

    <stunt name="Tough Love">
      The sorceress reaches inside another and Forcefully
      grabs any physical or mystical consequence or aspect.
      She can even choose to take a mystical or emotional
      ailment from another; accepting that consequence in
      the appropriate or higher slot or assuming an aspect
      as a mild consequence. The transferred consequence
      is considered addressed by this action, so the sorcerer
      needs only live with it until it naturally goes away.
