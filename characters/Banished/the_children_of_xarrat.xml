  <notes>
"Xarrat" is the Azerbaijani word for "carpenter".

Culty Goodness: Blood of the Masters (T:BS&amp;J, pg 170)
The **Shining Vampire Sect** kidnaps several masters
in order to drink their blood and steal their power

Probably more interesting of the Children of Xarrat aid the
PCs against the Shining Vampire Sect.

I should probably make a reverend of some sort.

Cf. Evil Cultists (T:BS&amp;J, pg 156)
