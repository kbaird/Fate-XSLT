    <description>
      Brick Accountant from the suburbs of the capital; his insistence on
      following rules got in the way of their corruption.
      Exiled to 饱江/Băo Jiāng with the impossible task of reducing graft.
      Tall and wide, but not fat. Bookish, not brutish.

      Followed by 陈达玉/Chén Dá Yù while investigating graft.
      She secretly aided him illegally, but he's too naive to notice.
      Acquired 刘丽华/Liú Lí Huá's statue from Madam 刘/Liú's grandchildren
      in lieu of back taxes.

    <gadget cost="1" name="Stone Crane 武術" notes="Careful, Clever:
      One of the most defensively solid styles, Stone
      Crane relies on solid stances and limiting an opponent’s
      ability to attack. Practitioners use blocks, circular
      evasion, locks, and pressure point strikes to avoid
      attacks and hinder opponents. Weaker on attack, Stone
      Crane stylists wait until the right opening and put an
      attacker down hard and fast.">
      <benefits>
        <benefit name="Mountain Does Not Fall">
          You get a +2 bonus to defend against attempts to
          create an advantage based on unbalancing,
          pushing, tripping, or knocking over the
          defender. If a technique from an opponent
          instead allows them to create such an
          advantage with free invocations, one
          less free invocation is granted though the
          advantage is still created.

        <benefit name="Stone Weathers the Storm">
          If you defend with style, you may remove your 1 stress box or
          convert another stress box to 1 lower instead of taking a boost.
        </benefit>
        <benefit name="Poisoned Mirror">
          The exorcist can redirect the
          energies sorcerers throw back to them. Success with
          style on a Defend against a mystical Attack lets the
          character describe turning the Attack back at the
          foe. Instead of generating a boost, inflict 1 stress on
          the attacker which cannot be blocked by any armor.
          Even though sorcerers are immune to Attacks of their
          element, the deflection infuses disruptive energies that
          they cannot ignore.
        </benefit>
        <benefit name="Spirit Commander">
          If the exorcist takes a spirit
          out, instead of banishing it outright, he can force it
          to perform a task before it departs. The supernatural
          being executes the task to the letter, but cannot harm
          or act against the exorcist. Once it completes the task
          or is released from service, it is banished.

  <notes>
    周's dad was a mason, ancestors were Earth Sorcerors, but that has been purged from history.
    When 周 got the statue, it registered as mystical and triggered his woo-woo sight.
    This allowed 周 to also notice that his abacus family heirloom is also magical. Details TBD.
    Some anonymous benefactor paid for 周's tuition to become an accountant.
