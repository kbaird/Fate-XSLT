# Session 3: Big Butcher Battle (2020-04-19)

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

An old "frenemy" of **Fungible 周**'s from the capital will swagger into
**饱江/Băo Jiāng** for "Falsely Accused"

Mo would like the **Silken Shadow Triad** to show up soon

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
- **Bloody Wei** (the 12th Butcher) is in stocks at the center of town
- The PCs destroyed the **Record of the Devil General** and taunted
  **Bloody Wei** with it in front of the whole town

(**Master Lei**'s actual killers were **Lao Bo**, **Elder Tong**, and **Bloody Wei**)

## Events

### Scene 5: _The Rooster Crows_ (pg12)
maybe just skip

### Scene 6: _King Rat_ (pg13)
**Golden Rat**, **Red Rooster**, **Green Dog**, **Violet Dragon**, and
12 mooks saunter into town

**Fungible 周** tries to rouse the townsfolk against them, fails;
**Ming** asks if he meant to do that

**Fungible 周** notices **White Rabbit** signalling **Rat** with the hiding locations
of **Chen** and **Mo**.

**Rat** asks for **Wei** to be let out, so the PCs can just leave town.
**Fungible 周** plays along, but is obvious to everyone. **Chen** succeeds,
creating _What are the PCs up to?_.
