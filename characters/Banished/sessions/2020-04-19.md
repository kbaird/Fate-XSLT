# Session 3: Big Butcher Battle (2020-04-19)

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

An old "frenemy" of **Fungible 周**'s from the capital will swagger into
**饱江/Băo Jiāng** for "Falsely Accused"

Mo would like the **Silken Shadow Triad** to show up soon

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
- **Bloody Wei** (the 12th Butcher) is in stocks at the center of town
- The PCs destroyed the **Record of the Devil General** and taunted
  **Bloody Wei** with it in front of the whole town
