# Session 6: A Trip to the Capital (2020-06-28)

## Ongoing Threads
Phil wants another fight

Brian is interested in the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
- Perhaps he should learn that **Fungible 周**'s _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect
  stems from them being the ones who paid for his education. Maybe they have a
  mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor** in The Third Age
  Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants acted as hosts for a visit from the
**Crown Prince 小龙/Xiǎolóng**, who came west to do "photo-op" military
service at a frontier garrison in **江州/Jiāngzhōu**. Bandits from the
barbarous west attacked, led by remnants of the **12 Golden Butchers**,
working with **Fish-Eye Cheng**.

After a longish battle, the PCs rescue the slaves and capture **Bei Kai**
(_The Bronze Horse_) and 8 mooks. **Elder Tong** and **Fish-Eye Cheng**
escape. Also, the Prince is indebted to the PCs for safegaurding him.

The Prince grows friendlier with the PCS, and reveals that the Emperor
has the Aspect _Growing Rumors of Shockingly Creative Cruelty_.

- Xuvutruobacaoly
- Consulting with **Geomancer 风/Fēng** to establish his innocence

## Events

The PCs are on their way to the capital to see what's what.

## Important NPCs/Groups

### The various Hells
- Consult with **Geomancer 风/Fēng** to establish innocence
- Retrieve a dead master
- What Angel tried to do in _Reprise_ (2.15): go kill the Senior Partners at home

### Xuvutruobacaoly
16 years ago, a demon attacked the Emperor and was killed by the Imperial
Guard and Peerless Master "Jordan Siegebreaker" (**Siegebreaker 经/Jīng**).

The "Court Wizard Phocas" (**Geomancer 风/Fēng**) was found to be in
league with the demon, and was executed.

#### What really happened:
**Jīng** summoned the demon **Xuvutruobacaoly**,
intending to rule as Regent after the Emperor was killed
- The demon used an illusion to trick **经/Jīng** into killing the Emperor
  when he thought he was killing the demon
- The demon now masquerades as the Emperor, and is only a slightly worse ruler
- **经/Jīng** had **Geomancer 风/Fēng** framed for the plot and executed
  (since **风/Fēng** would have discovered it) - consult in the Spirit World
  - **冥界/Míng Jiè** / "Dark/Gloomy Region" / **Meido**, the Realm of Waiting
    - _Fortune & Winds_, pg 51

If combined with _四天王_, maybe the Emperor's replacing has driven
**Empress Wu** insane from _GURPS Banestorm_ (pg 92)

### 中州/Zhōngzhōu and the Imperial Capital
**Regency Romance** from _Fate Adversary Toolkit_ (pg 106)
