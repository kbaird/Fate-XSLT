# Session 5: A Visit from the Prince (2020-06-14)

_GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 183)
- combine with other scenario, maybe _Saltmarsh_ or _Blood of the Masters_
  (T:BS&J pg171)
- **Prince 小龙/Xiǎolóng** can observe the PCs being awesome and possibly
  save his life

## Prep
Make sure I have
- a PDF copy of _Citadel By The Sea_ on the laptop
- a printed copy of **Ma Wei Sheng**, suitably modified to be the Prince

## Ongoing Threads
Phil wants another fight

Brian is interested in the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
- Perhaps he should learn that **Fungible 周**'s _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect
  stems from them being the ones who paid for his education. Maybe they have a
  mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor** in The Third Age
  Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants proved that "Brad" had been framed for the
murder of 3 acolytes of the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md),
led in **饱江/Băo Jiāng** by Priestess Khadija. The real culprit was
"The Duke", the secret leader of the **Forest Bandits**, who had attacked the
acolytes without permission, drawing too much attention.

## Events
**Prince 小龙/Xiǎolóng** comes west to do "photo-op" military service at a
frontier garrison in **江州/Jiāngzhōu**. Orcs from the barbarous west attack,
and an ancient citadel is discovered.

### 天橋山/Tiānqiáo Mountains
_Citadel by the Sea_ as a mountain keep/guardpost instead of coastal
- have some tenuous connection to the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
- introduction of **Red Orcs** from _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 62) /
  **Mines of the Mountain King** (pg 178)

### Scene 1: Royal Photo-Op
**Prince 小龙/Xiǎolóng** arrives in **饱江/Băo Jiāng**, to be escorted
by the PCs to the garrison in the mountains.

### Scene 2: Danger from the Barbarous West
The PCs and the Prince arrive at the garrison to news of an Orc attack on
nearby villages. The Prince insists on accompanying the scouting party.

Make sure that **Serga** has a metal pentagon necklace - the symbol of
the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md).

## Important NPCs/Groups

### "The Prince", 小龙/Xiǎolóng
_GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 183)
- Use **Ma Wei Sheng**
  - High Concept becomes _Heir Apparent to the Imperial Throne_
  - _Son of the Great General Ma_ becomes
  _Overconfident and Unchallenged (so far)_

A decent young man who will probably become a good emperor,
but currently stubborn & overconfident (trainers were reluctant to challenge him).
- Sent to do military service at a frontier garrison in **江州/Jiāngzhōu**
- could reveal that the Emperor has grown more erratic in the past several years
