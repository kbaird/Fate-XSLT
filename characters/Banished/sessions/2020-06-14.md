# Session 5: A Visit from the Prince (2020-06-14)

_GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 183)
- combine with other scenario, maybe _Saltmarsh_ or _Blood of the Masters_
  (T:BS&J pg171)
- **Prince 小龙/Xiǎolóng** can observe the PCs being awesome and possibly
  save his life

## Ongoing Threads
Phil wants another fight

Brian is interested in the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
- Perhaps he should learn that **Fungible 周**'s _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect
  stems from them being the ones who paid for his education. Maybe they have a
  mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor** in The Third Age
  Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants proved that "Brad" had been framed for the
murder of 3 acolytes of the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md),
led in **饱江/Băo Jiāng** by Priestess Khadija. The real culprit was
"The Duke", the secret leader of the **Forest Bandits**, who had attacked the
acolytes without permission, drawing too much attention.

## Events
**Prince 小龙/Xiǎolóng** comes west to do "photo-op" military service at a
frontier garrison in **江州/Jiāngzhōu**.

### 天橋山/Tiānqiáo Mountains
- **Red Orcs** from _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 62),
  **Mines of the Mountain King** (pg 178)
  - High tech Orcs on the border. Classic LE society as written: Cardassia,
    Darguun, etc.
    - Could be Muslim metaphor, deconstructions of various sorts, etc.
- _Citadel by the Sea_ as a mountain keep/guardpost instead of coastal
- _Ravenloft_
- Maybe _Tsojcanth_ and _Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_

## Important NPCs/Groups

### "The Prince", 小龙/Xiǎolóng
_GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 183)
- Use **Ma Wei Sheng**
  - High Concept becomes _Heir Apparent to the Imperial Throne_
  - _Son of the Great General Ma_ becomes
  _Overconfident and Unchallenged (so far)_

A decent young man who will probably become a good emperor,
but currently stubborn & overconfident (trainers were reluctant to challenge him).
- Sent to do military service at a frontier garrison in **江州/Jiāngzhōu**
- could reveal that the Emperor has grown more erratic in the past several years
