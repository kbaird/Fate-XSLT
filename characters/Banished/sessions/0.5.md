## 12 Golden Butchers

Chen and Zhou do research about
- Red Jade Center
- 2 Thunders Academy
- Master Lei
- Master Lei's _Record of the Devil General_
- The _12 Golden Butchers_

**Red Jade Center** is reachable by an up-river journey, followed by a day on the road.

Hong Mo sends Bao up ahead, Bao reports "lots"
Chen goes up and sees the bandits threatening the farmer **Chan Ho** and son **Chan Li**

Chen gets into backstab position
Hong Mo runs scared from the ghost
Lihua is the ghost
Zhou determines that the Chans are not yet injured

Chen creates **Well-Positioned to Attack** with 1 box
Hong Mo creates **Terrified Little Girl** with 1 box
LiHua creates **Holy Crap! There's a Ghost Over There!** with 1 box
Zhou builds up **Stone Crane Form** with 2 boxes
- needs to burn both to defend from Bandit attack

Chen sneak attacks and knocks out Big-Bellied Han with one hit
Hong Mo attacks several bandits, knocking out 3 or 4 of them
LiHua turns into a giant boulder and attacks several bandits, knocking out 3 or 4 of them
Zhou attacks several bandits, knocking out 2 of them
The remaining leaderless bandits flee in terror

The Chans are grateful, and reveal that the **12 Golden Butchers**
have taken over Red Jade Center

Remember for next time that Chen is up to 3 Fate Points from a Compel
