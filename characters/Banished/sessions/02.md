# Session 1: Red Jade Center (2020-04-05)

## Pre-session talk
Ask Brian if he's OK with Fungible å‘¨ having a _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect

He could use this as he likes, and it could cover the [Children of the
Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a msytical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
- **Bloody Wei** (the 12th Butcher) is stocks at the center of town
- The PCs have the **Record of the Devil General**, which they found
  hidden in the Boddhisatva statue.
