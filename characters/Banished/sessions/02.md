# Session 2: Red Jade Center (2020-04-05)

## Pre-session talk
Ask Brian if he's OK with Fungible 周 having a _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect

He could use this as he likes, and it could cover the [Children of the
Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

Ask someone for a friend who would be back in 饱江/Băo Jiāng for "Falsely Accused"
- An old "frenemy" of Fungible 周's from the capital will swagger into town

Mo would like the _Silken Shadow Triad_ to show up soon

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
- **Bloody Wei** (the 12th Butcher) is stocks at the center of town
- The PCs have the **Record of the Devil General**, which they found
  hidden in the Boddhisatva statue at **2 Thunders Academy**.
