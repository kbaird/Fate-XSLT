# Session 4: Back to 饱江/Băo Jiāng (2020-05-10)

_Eureka_ plot 1: "Falsely Accused"

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants saved **Red Jade Center** from being
terrorized by the **12 Golden Butchers**. Most of the Butchers, including the
leader **Golden Rat**, have been captured and taken into the custody of the
**饱江/Băo Jiāng** constabulary.

## Events

### Scene 1: Drop off the Butchers to Commissioner 过但/Guò Dàn
**Fungible 周** runs into **"Brad"**, An old "frenemy" from the capital, who
has swaggered into **饱江/Băo Jiāng**. Ask Brian in what specific ways he
throws his weight around. Continue with the post-**Brad** interaction with
**Commissioner 过但/Guò Dàn**.

### Scene 2: The Arrest
The PCs hear about **Brad**'s arrest. He was found unconscious next to the bodies
of 3 slain acolytes of the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md),
covered in their own blood. Evidence of a recently-abandoned bandit camp nearby.
General populace wants him executed quickly. If met with, he begs **Fungible 周**
to clear his name.

## Important NPCs/Groups

### "Brad"
Super-douche.

### Commissioner 过但/Guò Dàn
In charge of the **饱江/Băo Jiāng** constabulary. White hair, glasses, mustache,
as drawn in the Bronze Age by Jim Aparo.

### The Forest Bandits
They're known. They've generally restricted their offenses to banditry outside
the city limits, which is why **过但/Guò Dàn** has tolerated them as much as he
has: bigger fish to fry, limited resources, etc.

Compel **洪謨/Hóng Mó**'s _Raised by the Silken Shadow Triad_ when we learn that
they are affiliated with the **Silken Shadows**. Tipped off by their leader to
attack the PCs.

### "The Baron", The Foul-Seeming Noble Who's Kind of a Dick, Red Herring
Secretly extorting **Long Fu Song**, proprietor of the **Drunken Dragon Inn** (T:BS&J44)

### "The Countess", Red Herring
Secret alcoholic

### "The Duke", The Villanous Noble Really Leading the Bandits
Regularly visits the woods in disguise. Framed **Brad** because the **Forest Bandits**
had attacked the acolytes without permission. He didn't want to face retribution.

### Khadija, Whose Men Were Attacked
Priestess of the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md). Their new
temple has recently expanded into lumber. Can be met with. Thinks she once
recognized a bandit's horse as having been at **The Duke**'s stable.

### "The Copper Unicorns" (The Centaur Tribe)
Quite prone to attacking travelers, but they hate the **Forest Bandits**.
They can be convinced to aid
