# Session 4: Back to 饱江/Băo Jiāng (2020-05-10)

_Eureka_ "Falsely Accused"

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants saved **Red Jade Center** from being terrorized by the
**12 Golden Butchers**. Most of the Butchers, including the leader **Golden Rat**, have been
captured and taken into the custody of **饱江/Băo Jiāng** constabulary.

## Events

### Scene 1: Drop off the Butchers to Commissioner 过但/Guò Dàn
**Fungible 周** runs into **"Brad"**, An old "frenemy" from the capital, who has swaggered
into **饱江/Băo Jiāng**. Ask Brian in what specific ways he throws his weight around.

### Scene 2: The Arrest
The PCs hear about the 3 dead woodsmen and **Brad**'s arrest.
Found unconscious next to the bodies of 3 slain acolytes of the
[Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md), covered in their own blood.
Evidence of a recently-abandoned bandit camp nearby.
General populace wants him executed quickly.
Begs **Fungible 周** to clear his name.

## Important NPCs/Groups

### "Brad"
Super-douche.

Compel **洪謨/Hóng Mó**'s _Raised by the Silken Shadow Triad_ when we learn that they

### "The Duke", The Villanous Noble Really In Charge
Regularly visits the woods in disguise. Framed **Brad** because the **Forest Bandits**
had attacked the acolytes without permission. He didn't want to face retribution.

### Khadija, Whose Men Were Attacked
Priestess of the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md). Their new temple
has recently expanded into lumber. Can be met with. Thinks she once recognized a bandit's
horse as having been at **The Duke**'s stable.

### "The Copper Unicorns" (The Centaur Tribe)
Quite prone to attacking travelers, but they hate the **Forest Bandits**.
They can be convinced to aid
