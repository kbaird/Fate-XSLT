# Session 4: Back to 饱江/Băo Jiāng (2020-05-10)

_Eureka_ "Falsely Accused"

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

An old "frenemy" of **Fungible 周**'s from the capital will swagger into
**饱江/Băo Jiāng** for _Eureka_'s "Falsely Accused". What name did Brian pick?

While we're dealing with that, Compel **洪謨/Hóng Mó**'s _Raised by the Silken Shadow Triad_
to have someone show up and cause trouble (TBD). Maybe have it impact **陈/Chén** or
刘丽华/Liú Lí Huá if they've been off-screen.
