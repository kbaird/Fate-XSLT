# Session 4: Back to 饱江/Băo Jiāng (2020-05-10)

_Eureka_ "Falsely Accused"

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants saved **Red Jade Center** from being terrorized by the
**12 Golden Butchers**. Most of their number, including the leader **Golden Rat**, have been
captured and taken into custody in **饱江/Băo Jiāng**.

## Events
**"Brad"**, An old "frenemy" of **Fungible 周**'s from the capital, will swagger into
**饱江/Băo Jiāng** for _Eureka_'s "Falsely Accused".

While we're dealing with that, Compel **洪謨/Hóng Mó**'s _Raised by the Silken Shadow Triad_
to have someone show up and cause trouble (TBD). Maybe have it impact **陈/Chén** or
刘丽华/Liú Lí Huá if they've been off-screen.

## Important NPCs/Groups

### "Brad"
Found unconscious next to the bodies of 3 slain woodsmen, covered in their own blood.
Evidence of a recently-abandoned bandit camp nearby.
General populace wants him executed quickly.
Begs **Fungible 周** to cler his name.

### The Forest Bandits
**Silken Shadows**?
Tipped off by their leader to attack the PCs.

### The Villanous Noble Really In Charge
Regularly visits the woods in disguise. Framed **Brad** because the **Forest Bandits**
had attacked the woodsmen without permission. He didn't want to face retribution.

### The Baron Whose Men Were Attacked
Made his/her fortune in timber. Slain woodsmen were employees. Maybe make these the
[Children of the Xarrat](cthulhu_missionaries.md) instead to bring that thread in.
Can be met with. Thinks he once recognized a bandit's horse as having been at the
**Villanous Noble**'s stable.

### The Centaur Tribe
Quite prone to attacking travelers, but they hate the **Forest Bandits**.
They can be convinced to aid
