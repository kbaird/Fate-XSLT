# Session 4: Back to 饱江/Băo Jiāng (2020-05-17)

_Eureka_ plot 1: "Falsely Accused"

## Ongoing Threads
**Fungible 周** _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect for the [Children of the
Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md) being the ones who paid for his education.
Maybe they have a mystical hold on him, like **Saruman** over **Berethor**
in The Third Age Playstation game.

## "Previously, on _Banished_..."
**Fungible 周** and his assistants saved **Red Jade Center** from being
terrorized by the **12 Golden Butchers**. Most of the Butchers, including the
leader **Golden Rat**, have been captured and our heroes are escorting them
into the custody of the **饱江/Băo Jiāng** constabulary.

## Events

### Scene 1: Drop off the Butchers to Commissioner 过但/Guò Dàn
**Fungible 周** runs into **"Brad"**, An old "frenemy" from the capital, who
has swaggered into **饱江/Băo Jiāng**. Ask Brian in what specific ways he
throws his weight around. Continue with the post-**Brad** interaction with
**Commissioner 过但/Guò Dàn**. The PCs give a reasonable summary of the
events in **Red Jade Center**, but don't mention the scroll.

### Scene 2: The Arrest
The PCs hear about **Brad**'s arrest. He was found unconscious next to the
bodies of 3 slain acolytes of the
[Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md), covered in their own
blood. Evidence of a recently-abandoned bandit camp nearby. General populace
wants him executed quickly. If met with, he begs **Fungible 周** to clear his
name. **Fungible 周** agrees to serve as Brad's lawyer.

### Scene 3: Gathering Info

Brad met the Baron at the Drunken Dragon Inn.
This meeting was going to be the first transfer of goods.

**陈达玉 Chén** and **洪謨/Hóng Mó** are ambushed by Silken Shadows;
**洪謨/Hóng Mó** knocks out one that she
recognizes. **陈达玉 Chén** attacks the nearest: "That's how you throw a punch."
**洪謨/Hóng Mó** knocks out that one. The remaining two run away.

**Fungible 周** and Liu were leaving for the temple, notice the ruckus,
and rejoin the party.

**陈达玉 Chén** noticed that they were tailing for reasons unrelated to Hong Mo's
history with them. Liu Forcefully interrogates the 2 prisoners. They
can get Brad temporarily released into **Fungible 周**'s custody.

**陈达玉 Chén** takes Brad aside and tells him to behave.

The PCs go to the morgue to _Speak with Dead_.
- What were you doing before and leading up to your murder?
  - We were attacked while scouting a location for the temple's mill.
- Why would someone want to kill you?
  - We don't know.
- What do you now about this man [Brad]?
  - Nothing. We have never seen him before.
- What else should we know to bring you justice?
  - We were killed by a group of the Forest Bandits riding horses with a
    pine tree brand.

The coroner saw all of this, and can confirm it. This is probably enough to
exonerate Brad.

The PCs go to the temple of [the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md).
**Fungible 周** is able to discover the Aspect _We Have Genuine Occult Power_.
_New Foreign Religion From the West_ is also fairly clear fairly early.
They also learn _We Scrupulously Keep Our Noses Clean_ in the course of
questioning.

**Fungible 周** goes to the house of records. The bodies were found on
unclaimed land. He also learns that the pine tree brand is owned by "The Duke",
who does not own any land in the forest.

The PCs go back to the **Drunken Dragon**. **Fungible 周** learns about the
beer argument. He has heard from multiple customers that the Duke has been
seen going to and from the forest at night, for no known reason. He lives
in an area of the city that is more plagued by the **Silken Shadows**.

**陈达玉 Chén** spends a Fate Point to learn that The Duke is The Kingpin. Some forest
bandits got over-eager and killed the acolytes. The Duke had them killed and
framed Bard to try to shake the heat.

#### Threads

##### The Baron
Guo Dan is sick of putting up with him.

##### The Bandits
called "The Forest Bandits"
The Copper Unicorns are in conflict with them

##### The Cult
Led by a priestess named Khadija
squeeky clean
looking to get into lumber for the temple's self-sufficiency

##### The Baron's Argument with Long Fu Song
The Baron wanted to sell beer at too steep a price and Long Fu Song refused.

##### Pine Tree Brand

## Important NPCs/Groups

### "Brad"
Super-douche. Smug and tedious. Does the least amount of work and claims
credit for other people's work. Dudebro. Goes to Tahoe for the weekend.
Would've worked at Sqor. He's in **饱江/Băo Jiāng** for unclear reasons.

### Commissioner 过但/GuòDàn
In charge of the **饱江/Băo Jiāng** constabulary. White hair, glasses,
mustache, as drawn in the Bronze Age by Jim Aparo.

### The Forest Bandits
They're known. They've generally restricted their offenses to banditry outside
the city limits, which is why **过但/Guò Dàn** has tolerated them as much as
he has: bigger fish to fry, limited resources, etc.

Compel **洪謨/Hóng Mó**'s _Raised by the Silken Shadow Triad_ when we learn
that they are affiliated with the **Silken Shadows**. Tipped off by their
leader to attack the PCs.

### "The Baron", The Foul-Seeming Noble Who's Kind of a Dick, Red Herring
Secretly extorting **Long Fu Song**, proprietor of the
**Drunken Dragon Inn** (T:BS&J44)

### "The Countess", Red Herring
Secret alcoholic

### "The Duke", The Villanous Noble Really Leading the Bandits
Regularly visits the woods in disguise. Framed **Brad** because the
**Forest Bandits** had attacked the acolytes without permission. He didn't
want to face retribution.

### Khadija, Whose Men Were Attacked
Priestess of the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md). Their
new temple has recently expanded into lumber. Can be met with. Thinks she once
recognized a bandit's horse as having been at **The Duke**'s stable.

### "The Copper Unicorns" (The Centaur Tribe)
Quite prone to attacking travelers, but they hate the **Forest Bandits**.
They can be convinced to aid

## Ongoing Threads for next time
Brian is interested in the Children of the Xarrat
Phil wants another fight
