    <gadget cost="1" name="Iron Leopard 武術" notes="Forceful, Quick:
      Iron Leopard stylists are among the hardest hitting fighters around, mixing strong blows with
      deadly precision to deliver powerful blows to an opponent's weakest points. They rely upon speed
      and maneuverability in defense, preferring a more aggressive, less defensive approach than other Leopard
      practitioners. They are neither careless nor reckless but unrelentingly persistent in their offense.">

          If the character succeeds with style on a Fight Attack, they can add a +3 Weapon Rating to the current Attack

          When making a Fight Attack action, gain a +1 bonus and +1 Weapon Rating if the character’s action last turn was not an Attack.

        <benefit name="Secret Technique: Iron Leopard Palm">
          Spend 1 fate point and make a Fight Attack action. This has a +2 Weapon Rating, and also removes
          one invocation on the target’s Form or Chi Armor (target’s choice). If the Attack succeeds with style, it
          removes another invocation in addition to gaining a boost. If a target has no invocations to remove when
          the Attack hits, it does an additional +1 Weapon Rating instead (+2 additional if Attack succeeds with style).
