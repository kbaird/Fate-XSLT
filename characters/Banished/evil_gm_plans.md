## Specific Threads

### PC-specific Threads

#### Fungible 周/Zhōu
His _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect represents the
[Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
being the ones who paid for his accountant education.

#### 刘丽华/Liú Lí Huá
- Confront **Madam 刘/Liú**

#### 洪謨/Hóng Mó
- Silken Shadow Triad comes looking for her
  - Tipped off during _Falsely Accused_ via the Forest Bandits

#### 陈达玉/Chén Dá Yù
- Mostly compels on _Has an insatiable need to punish the corrupt_

### 饱江/Băo Jiāng
Think about a guest appearance from **Detective Dishi**

_To Live and Die in Băo Jiāng_ (T:BS&J, pg 164)
- **Princess Ju** visits **饱江/Băo Jiāng** with an Imperial Seal;
  **Forger Bai** wants to copy it

### Culty Goodness
Moved to the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)

### Detective Dee & The Four Heavenly Kings (四天王)
**"Wind Warriors"** assisted the rise of the current Dynasty and were then betrayed.

**Empress Wu** imagines the (actually dead) **"Faceless Lord"** is directing her
plot to frame **Detective Dee**.
- Might overlap with _Banestorm_ plot, but could also be a good prep.
- Also has some Doppleganger stuff

### Fragrant Harbor
Conan's _Pit of Kutallu_ (fishmen, cultists)
- could be a prep to _Saltmarsh_

### Silk River
- The [**Children of the Xarrat**](../cthulhu_missionaries.md) building up sympathy
- **Riverton** from _Fate Worlds Volume One: Worlds on Fire_ (first scenario)

### 天橋山/Tiānqiáo Mountains
_Citadel by the Sea_ as a mountain keep/guardpost instead of coastal
- have some tenuous connection to the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
- **Red Orcs** from _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 62),
  **Mines of the Mountain King** (pg 178)
  - High tech Orcs on the border
    Classic LE society as written: Cardassia, Darguun, etc.
    Could be Muslim metaphor, deconstructions of various sorts, etc.
- _Ravenloft_
- Maybe _Tsojcanth_ and _Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_
