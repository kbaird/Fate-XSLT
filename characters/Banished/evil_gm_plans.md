## Specific Threads

### PC-specific Threads

#### Fungible 周/Zhōu
His _Mysterious Leverage_ Aspect represents the
[Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)
being the ones who paid for his accountant education.

#### 刘丽华/Liú Lí Huá
- Confront **Madam 刘/Liú**

#### 洪謨/Hóng Mó
- Silken Shadow Triad comes looking for her
  - Tipped off during _Falsely Accused_ via the Forest Bandits

#### 陈达玉/Chén Dá Yù
- Mostly compels on _Has an insatiable need to punish the corrupt_

### 饱江/Băo Jiāng
Think about a guest appearance from **Detective Dishi**

_To Live and Die in Băo Jiāng_ (T:BS&J, pg 164)
- **Princess Ju** visits **饱江/Băo Jiāng** with an Imperial Seal;
  **Forger Bai** wants to copy it

### Culty Goodness
Moved to the [Children of the Xarrat](../cthulhu_missionaries.md)

### Detective Dee & The Four Heavenly Kings (四天王)
**"Wind Warriors"** assisted the rise of the current Dynasty and were then betrayed.

**Empress Wu** imagines the (actually dead) **"Faceless Lord"** is directing her
plot to frame **Detective Dee**.
- Might overlap with _Banestorm_ plot, but could also be a good prep.
- Also has some Doppleganger stuff

### Fragrant Harbor
Conan's _Pit of Kutallu_ (fishmen, cultists)
- could be a prep to _Saltmarsh_

### The various Hells
- Consult with **Geomancer 风/Fēng** to establish innocence
- Retrieve a dead master
- What Angel tried to do in _Reprise_ (2.15): go kill the Senior Partners at home

### Silk River
- The [**Children of the Xarrat**](../cthulhu_missionaries.md) building up sympathy
- **Riverton** from _Fate Worlds Volume One: Worlds on Fire_ (first scenario)

### More 天橋山/Tiānqiáo Mountains
- **Red Orcs** from _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 62),
  **Mines of the Mountain King** (pg 178)
  - High tech Orcs on the border
    Classic LE society as written: Cardassia, Darguun, etc.
    Could be Muslim metaphor, deconstructions of various sorts, etc.
  - Some details revealed by _Citadel By the Sea_ scenario on
    [2020-06-14](sessions/2020-06-14.md)
- _Ravenloft_
- Maybe _Tsojcanth_ and _Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_

### Xuvutruobacaoly
16 years ago, a demon attacked the Emperor and was killed by the Imperial
Guard and Peerless Master "Jordan Siegebreaker" (**Siegebreaker 经/Jīng**).

The "Court Wizard Phocas" (**Geomancer 风/Fēng**) was found to be in
league with the demon, and was executed.

#### What really happened:
**Jīng** summoned the demon **Xuvutruobacaoly**,
intending to rule as Regent after the Emperor was killed
- The demon used an illusion to trick **经/Jīng** into killing the Emperor
  when he thought he was killing the demon
- The demon now masquerades as the Emperor, and is only a slightly worse ruler
- **经/Jīng** had **Geomancer 风/Fēng** framed for the plot and executed
  (since **风/Fēng** would have discovered it) - consult in the Spirit World
  - **冥界/Míng Jiè** / "Dark/Gloomy Region" / **Meido**, the Realm of Waiting
    - _Fortune & Winds_, pg 51

If combined with _四天王_, maybe the Emperor's replacing has driven
**Empress Wu** insane from _GURPS Banestorm_ (pg 92)

### 中州/Zhōngzhōu and the Imperial Capital
**Regency Romance** from _Fate Adversary Toolkit_ (pg 106)
