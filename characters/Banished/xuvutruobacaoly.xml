    <gadget cost="1" name="Hidden Serpent 武術" notes="Sneaky, Quick:
      Practitioners of Forest Serpent use speed and misdirection in ways that
      make them some of the cagiest fighters in the land. They will never
      commit to an action or position they cannot quickly retreat from and
      prefer to lure opponents into situations where they can finish a fight
      with a series of quick, precise blows. Any vulnerability in a foe is to
      be identified and exploited the moment it is safe to do so.">
