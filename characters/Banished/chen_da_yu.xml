    <description>
      Nondescript young woman in her mid-twenties.
      Dark hair and eyes. Very forgettable.

      Following Fungible 周/Zhōu as he was investigating graft.
      Secretly aiding him illegally, but he's too naive to notice.
      Followed around by 洪謨/Hóng Mó, who appreciates having been
      "rescued" from the Silken Shadows.

    <gadget cost="2" name="Ghost Serpent 武術" notes="Clever, Quick:
      Ghost Serpent practitioners are some of the most elusive, graceful, and
      unpredictable fighters. Their swift, smooth strikes slide past defenses
      to find vital points in an opponent and their subtle shifting dodges and
      blocks turn aside blows that seemed would connect. Feints and locks
      augment these methods and allow the stylist to control a battle, keeping
      an opponent from bringing his full power to bear on the Ghost Serpent.
      Practitioners favor speed and precision over power, eschewing powerful
      but slower methods for a flurry of well-aimed and timed techniques.">
      <benefits>
        <benefit name="Serpent Strikes Twice">
          +2 bonus to Sneaky rolls to create an advantage based on
          disorientation, distraction, or unbalancing against opponents
          you have already inflicted stress on this combat.
        </benefit>
        <benefit name="Serpent Bites the Hand">
          If you gain shifts on a defense, you can sacrifice your action next
          turn to immediately inflict an attack on your opponent using the
          shift value of your defense as your attack result.
        </benefit>
        <benefit name="Ghost Haunts the Shadow">
          You may use Clever instead of Sneaky to Create an Advantage based on
          stealth or concealment. If Sneaky is greater or equal to a character's
          Clever approach, gain a +2 bonus to such rolls instead.
