 <stunts>
  <stunt name="Borrowed Knowledge">
   Pick another character (PC or NPC) who’s in the scene with you. You can use
   one of their skills for one roll in this scene, whether it’s a skill you
   already have or not. When you do this, pay that character a fate point.
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Cutting Words">
   When you invoke one of a target’s aspects as part of creating an advantage
   with Provoke, spend a fate point to also deal them a mental hit equal to the
   number of shifts you obtain on the roll.
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Deep Tesladyne Cover">
   When operating undercover, you can use Deceive in place of Provoke or
   Rapport, as long as you’re acting “in character.”
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Mind Reader">
   When you use Empathy to create an advantage by discovering another character’s
   aspects, you don’t need to speak with them and it takes virtually no time.
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Versatile Deceive">
   Switch ANY skill with Deceive once per scene
