    High Concept: Failed Prototype? More specific phrasing?
      The USS Defiant NX-74205 might be "Overpowered Cannons With a Warp Drive Strapped On the Back"
    Trouble: Non-Asimovian Abomination? Somebody Wants Me Back? Secretly Has Free Will?
    Questions:
      An attempt at a faster planing engine was not successful. What sort of ship were you intended to be?
      What part of that failed, and what parts were still successful?
      Also non-Asimovian. By mistake or design? Who knows this?
      What is your name?
      Are there other ships with a similar or identical design?
      Are you an "Alpha Quadrant Jem'Hadar" with a rivalry with your predecessors?
      Or are you the old deprecated model?
      Are you a cargo ship? A sporty little VIP passenger yacht? An infiltrator? A "family sedan"?
      Do you have a gender? What pronouns do people use for you?
      Do you have an Avatar?
      When people see you, do they say "That's a one-of-a-kind ship", "What is that?", or "There's another XYZ"?
