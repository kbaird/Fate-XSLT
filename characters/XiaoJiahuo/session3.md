# Session 3 (2016-10-22)

Steffan overhears people in the Blooming Lotus discussing **Gilios Shipping** (his family's
former smuggling operation) and/or **Etihad Airships**. **Gilios Shipping** was taken over by
**Leyla Beni Gökay** - the **Beni Gökay** family has run **Etihad Airships**, a direct competitor
of **Hawthrone Droneworks**, for years, while **Gilios Shipping** was only taken over quite
recently by Leyla personally as a part of Steffan's backstory.

陈 (Chén / Snitchy McSnitchface) observes this and reports it to Hamza, who confronts
Steffan about violating the club's Prime Directive. Steffan is unaware of 陈's involvement.
Steffan is quite angry with Hamza, but the matter is otherwise resolved.

Julphar Pharmaceutical Chaemerics (JPC) offers 五 (Wǔ) a job, which he is thinking over

陈 (Chén) tracks the goon's payer to Hawthorne, where he meets w/Isabella

陈 (Chén) is spotted, but gets away

## Jade Concoctions
  - **Golgari** Black & Green anti-pyschotic for Dilar's sister
  - **Green Prozac** very similar to _Golgari_; 五 (Wǔ) tasked to work on this for miners
  - **Snow Cone** White Jade perception booster, found on murder victims
  - **Nitrous Oxide** White Jade fuel efficiency booster

## 1st Murder (from before)
  - in Terminal Strip
  - 陈 (Chén) knew the victim, who was a street vendor and informant

## 2nd Murder (from before)
  - in Three Corners (near the middle High Port tower)
  - no obvious ethnic or other connection
  - victim was employed as domestic help, 陈 (Chén) did not know
  - **Snow Cone** residue found

## 3rd Murder (this session)
  - in Terminal Strip
  - very similar to previous 2 murders
  - victim is homeless
  - _Snow Cone_ residue found
  - Aspects discovered
    - _**Snow Cone** is used by Hawthorne drone pilots and others_
    - Suspect in Stevedore custody named 李建华 (Li Jiànhuá)
      - his Portrayal is _Rickshaw Driver; Former Drone Pilot_
      - his Secret is _**Snow Cone** Has Driven Me Pyschotic_

The PCs discover that **Hawthrone Droneworks** was using **Snow Cone** on its drone
pilots for the municipal surveillance contract, and that it made 李建华 (Li Jiànhuá)
and the other pilots homicidal. Hawthorne (through its representative Isabella Clarke)
is trying to get **Golgari** to clean up the mess while simultaneously employing 五 to
work on **Green Prozac**.
