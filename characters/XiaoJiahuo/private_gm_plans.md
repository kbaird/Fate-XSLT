# Private GM Plans

## TODO:
  - Ask everyone if they're cool with the 3 Kausao City Aspects as written
  - Ask people about their nationalities / names, if not set yet
  - All of Brian's specific questions
  - Stephen's specific questions about the family business
  - Ask Jenn/Chris what the name of the club is
  - Ask Phil what Chen's master's name was
  - Think of a name for a LMC/MMC district (where the murders will start)
  - Give each PC a private spotlight to describe their typical day
  - NPC actions:
    - The drug-induced murders
    - Stephen hears that someone is looking for Jenn's potion
      - then someone raids the the club
    - A murder in _[District]_

### Brian
  - Explorer swashbuckler (Ben Sisko masquerading as his mirror counterpart)
  - What's the name of his Vigilance Committee?
    - What are they like?
    - What kind of neighborhood do they operate in?
    - Do they have any sort of ethnic or political affiliation?
    - Do they have any sort of connection to organized crime?
    - Without giving anything away, might they be involved in Chen's _Shīfu_'s death,
      on either side?

### Stephen Gilios (Chris)
  - What's the deal with the family business?
    - Did Stephen grow up rich?
    - Who took their assets?
    - What sort of business was it?
    - Is it still operating?
    - Was it legal?
    - Did it / does he still have any relationship to a Vigilance Committee,
      organized crime, and/or either the High or Low Port?
  - Before Jenn's mansion/club are attacked,
    hears that someone is interested in her psych potion

### Jenn
  - Someone from _Hawthorne Droneworks_ raids her mansion or club for drug used for sister
    - turns out it is a slight mod of _[Researcher]_'s original formula
  - **Inciting Incident**: _Who's After the Formula, and Why?_

### Mike
  - working on Green & Blue elixirs for psych restoration and resilience,
    told that it's for miners (restoration actually for affected pilots)
  - give him some red herring projects as well
  - eventually finds files for proposed (Green + Blue + Black) resilience potion,
    vetoed by management as too expensive
    - _[Researcher]_ left & took formula

### Chen Daiyu (Phil)
  - _Wuxia_ martial artist (**Ghost Serpent**)
  - works as domestic staff, making the highty-toighty rounds, searching for master's killer
    - _Shīfu_ was a flawed man who worked with 江湖, remembered w/rose-colored glasses
    - Specific 江湖 cell was political/national (like Triads or Mafia)
    - _Shīfu_ discovered a conspiracy by either Low Port merchants or "Communists"
      to seize the High Port and was silenced (JP99, STotC Indonesia 1951)
      - _38 Dragons_ ("Triple Prosperity") crime family or
        _People's Front for Rectification of Grievances_

### Setting/Shared
  - Series of murders around Kausao City, all in Lower Middle Class to Middle Class
    neighborhoods (where drone pilots would live)
  - Maybe some suspects caught by local Vigilance Committees
    - except they're innocent, typical VC frameup of enemies
    - one is actually guilty, worked as a drone pilot 3 jobs ago

### "Courtney" NPC (if needed)
  - Several red herrings for technical problems with the drones
  - Some fancy parties, she's expected to attend to show the corp/family flag
  - through [Some Method] discovers evidence of coverup
