# Private GM Plans

## TODO:
  - Ask everyone if they're cool with the 3 Kausao City Aspects as written
  - Ask people about their nationalities / names, if not set yet
  - All of _[Brian]_'s specific questions
  - _[Stephen Gilios]_' specific questions about the family business
  - Ask Jenn/Chris what the name of the club is
  - Ask Phil what _[Chen Daiyu]_'s master's name was
  - Think of a name for a LMC/MMC district (where the murders will start)
  - Give each PC a private spotlight to describe their typical day
  - NPC actions:
    - The drug-induced murders
    - _Stephen Gilios_ hears that someone is looking for Jenn's potion
      - then someone raids the the club
    - A murder in _[District]_

### PCs

#### Brian

    - What are they like?
    - What kind of neighborhood do they operate in?
    - Do they have any sort of ethnic or political affiliation?
    - Do they have any sort of connection to organized crime?
    - Without giving anything away, might they be involved in Chen's _Shīfu_'s death,
      on either side?

#### Stephen Gilios
  - What's the deal with the family business?
    - Did Stephen grow up rich?
    - Who took their assets?
    - What sort of business was it?
    - Is it still operating?
    - Was it legal?
    - Did it / does he still have any relationship to a Vigilance Committee,
      organized crime, and/or either the High or Low Port?
  - Before Jenn's mansion/club are attacked,
    hears that someone is interested in her psych potion

  - **Inciting Incident**: _Who's After the Formula, and Why?_

#### Mike
  - working on Green & Blue elixirs for psych restoration and resilience,
    told that it's for miners (restoration actually for affected pilots)

        _People's Front for Rectification of Grievances_
