# Jadepunk GM Plans

## Events

### 2016-07-30
- _Isabella Clarke_ (F Aerish) visits [The Blooming Lotus] on behalf of [Hawthorne Droneworks],
  asking for the Black Jade formula [Dilar] uses to treat her sister
- One of her goons is captured by Chen and Steffan, brought back to the Blooming Lotus for
  questioning.

### 2016-09-10 TODO
- Onboard Mike
- Figure out the captured goon and what he knows
- The drug-induced murders in _[Terminal Strip]_
  - Series of murders around Kausao City, all in Lower Middle Class to Middle Class
    neighborhoods (where drone pilots would live)
    - 1st one in [Terminal Strip], but not all
  - Maybe some suspects caught by local Vigilance Committees
    - except they're innocent, typical VC frameup of enemies
    - one is actually guilty, worked as a drone pilot 3 jobs ago

## Terminal Strip

A neighborhood in Kausao City just southwest of the westernmost High Port tower, at
the intersection of the Aerish, Kaiyumi, and Túyàngan areas.

- _The Blooming Lotus_ is here.
