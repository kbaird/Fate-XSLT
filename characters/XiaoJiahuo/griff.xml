    His mother was an Aerish servant to a wealthy family in Kausao City. Growing up alongside the family's son, he
    enjoyed some hand-me-down luxuries unusual for a poor child, including a second-hand education. On adulthood,
    however, the two young men had a falling out: The rich man’s cronies conned his ill mother out of her savings,
    selling her a junked airship. The rich man refused to help: The poor would always be poor, he claimed; it was
    an inherent part of their breeding. The poor man snapped, and disappeared into the city.

    Over the next few years, he took the dirtiest jobs to pay for repairs to the airship. (Meanwhile, his former
    “friend” and his cronies somehow died in accidents or vanished mysteriously.) Eventually, the former servant’s
    son emerged as “Griff Lewelling”, clownish freelance captain of minor renown. It's a cover he uses to sew chaos
    among the upper class.

    professions:
    Scoundrel (+3) - clown, charmer, burglar, con-man
    Explorer (+2) - airship pilot
    Fighter (+2) - assassin
    Engineer (+1) - airship repair
    Scholar (+1)
    Aristocrat (+0)

    Not sure what to call his vigilance committee. Like him, they put up a public front to mask their true purpose:
    death and chaos to the rich. His job would involve a lot of contact with the wealthy, so their HQ would at least
    be in a middle-class part of town at the worst. Because of the airships, the public sees them as very Aerish.
    Probably with a Naramel minority, given the the groups' history.

    But they see themselves as the voice of the voiceless, so they'd at least have a satellite office in the slums.
    (Maybe connected via tunnel? Or maybe nobody really pays attention to where airships land?) And all races are
    welcome in the revolution; they're really more into class warfare. Definite connections to organized crime,
    mainly as a transportation company. But the higher-ups in the mob also know of their talents at assassination.

    "Are they political?" Hell, yes. Eat the rich. Death to the 1%. Chaos. Anarchy. Watch ’em all burn.
