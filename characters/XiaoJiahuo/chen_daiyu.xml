    <story>
      陈 was a Túyàngan street rat in Kausao, rescued from attackers by a martial artist who became
      her Shīfu (師父), training her in Ghost Serpent style and inducting her into the Jianghu (江湖).
      He is remembered by her with rose-colored glasses, ignoring his flaws (to be specified in
      greater detail as we play). He was also murdered; details TBD.
      陈 now works as domestic staff, making the highty-toighty rounds, searching
      for his killer.
