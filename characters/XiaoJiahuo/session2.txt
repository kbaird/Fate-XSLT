Notes from 2016-09-10 session (2nd) from Phil:

overview - reminiscent of Hong Kong with a lot of colonial presence, lots of jade deposits were discovered in the bay (like lots of black jade), all four great nations have a presence in the city, settlements grew together into a city and a governing council was established to ensure general order, vigilance committees trying to keep order separate from the council but also corrupt probably, mayor has held onto the position for 20 years longer than he should
Stefan and Daiyu - offered Daiyu a position as his muscle, she's not personally interested in getting involved just wants to watch and defend Stefan
Side note - Wu is located just north of the west tower, he's mostly been surrounded by academics or major political figures, he's trying to streamline/eliminate the need for white jade through a hugely efficient processing method, contemplating getting himself and his team out of the city, has an established professional relationship with Dilar (he knows her secret and helped her develop her potion)
There are some major mining companies - Python Mining Corporation (Four Winds Trading Company - Aerum), the Daiyu Corporation, Shaio, Yestes Mines, and Kinzokai
The Blooming Lotus
- Just A 'Club'
- Where No One Speaks Your Name
- With A Higher Class Of Scum And Villainy
Wu arranged to meet with Dilar at the Blooming Lotus
Back to the interrogation - Stefan compels himself Laws Are Not Boundaries To Justice
Stefan gives initiative to goon
Goon establishes Made Some Enemies That Could Come Looking <x>
Stefan is trying to intimidate the goon and not doing great until Daiyu twists his arm
- Willing to Talk
Who Do You Work For? He's like a day laborer from Thug Depot, he agrees to let us follow him to his payment
Knock on the door, Hamza takes care of it
Daiyu discovers the cops are bribable, we super bribe the cops, we intend to follow the goon to his payment
Back to Dilar who leaves her sacked apartment to go to her meeting with Wu at the Blooming Lotus
Everyone shows up at the inn at the same time
Stefan checks in with Hamza on what he should do
Hamza - General Manager of the Blooming Lotus
Need - Some Day My Family Honor Will Be Restored
Dilar and Wu are having their conversation in a dark corner - gets into the chemical nature of jade and his findings
Wu reveals he has a team of five who are the only ones aware, as far as he knows
Dilar offers to talk to some people about helping him get himself and his team out of the city, asks for a week to think on this further, Dilar can tell he's hiding something
Wu goes home on a rickshaw, followed by Griff at Dilar's behest
Someone runs in the club announcing a murder, Hamza sends a busboy to learn more, it's some local who was brutally murdered
Dilar goes back to her apartment to check on ransacking
Daiyu and Stefan follow skippy the thug
Secret aspect invoked about Isabella - No One Must Know That I...
Someone else shows up to pay, Daiyu leaves but agrees to meet him later, Stefan follows them to where they live
Back to Dilar and Griff - Jen rolls poorly twice, succeeds at cost - they were professionals who left a mess to send a message, they left out the window suggesting an airship escape, looks like the work of in-house staff from one of the bigger corporations, Griff suspects (quietly) it might be his own guild, she can't discern it except she succeeds at a cost (again), but she figures they'll be back and they know that she's Madam Lotus, she makes a statement to the cops and goes home 
Griff later goes back to work to check on his suspicions that they actually ransacked Dilar's apartment, he suspects who did the job and thinks it was sloppy work, he gets confirmation and approaches the culprit, he thinks they halfassed the job because of time, he suggests they can clue him in and he can time things better so they don't have to be sloppy
Next day - Reports about that person who got murdered, very violent nothing stolen no suspects, Griff's guide has a suspect for said murder
Wu goes back to work, plays normal
Dilar drops hints that she is looking for a way to get Wu out of the city
Daiyu knew the guy who was murdered, he was a street vendor and informant, she tracks down the guy to learn about Isabella, leans on servants to discover she Works Near the West Tower
Wu - he hangs a lotus on his door to send a message to someone else, one of his leads comes to his room and he asks them about the research and they say it won't work, he knows it's possible but his team thinks they're trying to discover it, company that originally discovered it tried to destroy it, but it got sent to another company instead and that's how it got to Wu
Gryff - learns that Yamada Keiko killed the dude, she works at the deli, she's a member of an opposing vigilance committee
There is another murder this evening in another neighborhood (Three Corners), similar socio-economic profile, lower middle class, no blatant ethnic connection, murder itself is almost identical
Stefan - investigating said murder with an excellent roll, both bodies have trace amounts of white jade residue, evidence points to it having been on the perpetrator, its most recent exposure was old, the treatment is not the same as the fuel treatment, consistent with perception alteration but not the recreational type
Wu thinks the compound is oddly familiar but he isn't sure
