# Session 4 (2017-06-11)

陈 approaches Dilar, knowing that she is Madame Lotus, works out a plan to work for her directly

Griff approached by Strangler 包 to assassinate 陈 who is getting too close to figuring out that
  Strangler 包 was the one who killed her mentor Hiro
Griff also wakes up to the poisoning note, recognizes handwriting as fellow Guildie Jeremy

陈 gets a lead on Hiro's killer, not yet knowing that it is 包, gets a ride in Griff's airship up to the hills
  Goes to Penelope 王's fancy party, which Dilar is attending, they recognize each other, Penelope notices

Griff hires 五 to examine him, and learns that he was poisoned with **Snow Cone**, 五 tells him **Golgari**
  will work

Steffan sends a Jadegram to the Blooming Lotus informing that Hamza is working for Strangler 包, intended
  as a threat to Hamza, who will intercept it as a part of his job

Griff goes to the bar, asks Steffan for some **Golgari**, they confront Hamza, who spills all the beans,
  including that Dilar is Madame Lotus, Griff & Steffan go to the 王 party with Hamza in the trunk

陈 is attacked by Bloody Wei, the Brass Pig. She easily beats him & learns that Strangler 包 wants her dead

Griff, et al pick up Dilar at the 王 mansion, 陈 sneaks around and hangs off the side, they tell Dilar
  everything

Group brainstorms about Strangler 包 and any potential connections to Dilar (none that I know of)

陈 gets from Hamza that Strangler 包 is Penelope 王, and wants 陈 dead because Strangler 包 killed Hiro

Dilar lets Hamza go (in both senses), he's dead if he talks, and should probably leave Kausao
  Also shuts down the Blooming Lotus, and contacts 五 to say she's going to patent **Golgari** and
  release it legally.

陈 decides to whack Strangler 包 at the Grand Ball. Steffan is onboard because Penelope is married
  to a **Beni Gökay**. 

They do so. Things aren't looking great for Steffan, but even worse for Strangler 包.
