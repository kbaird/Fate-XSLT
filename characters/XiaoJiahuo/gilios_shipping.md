# Gilios Shipping

## Previously Established

Steffan grew up rich from the family's smuggling earnings. It continues to
operate after having been taken over by **someone in the government**.

## Remaining Questions
- What specific contraband(s) did they deal in?
  - The family shipped Jade, but skimmed off of the top and sold it to rebels.
    Of course the government knows, they encouraged it. An armed threat is good politics.
- Who's the perp?
  - A corporate official Leyla Beni Gökay (F Naramel) decided to cut out the middle man and
    framed Steffan's family, only to take over the shipping for him/herself.
    Steffan plans to return the favor.
- Was the motivation just the revenue, or something else?
  - Just revenue
- What plans does Steffan have for revenge, if any?
  - Still planning, some form of public disgrace
- What would prompt immediate action on Steffan's part?
  - News of the increased smuggling prices could prompt Steffan to action. The rebels can't likely pay increases.
