# Gilios Shipping

## Previously Established

Steffan grew up rich from the family's smuggling earnings. It continues to
operate after having been taken over by **someone in the government**.

## Remaining Questions
- What specific contraband(s) did they deal in?
- Who's the perp?
- Was the motivation just the revenue, or something else?
- What plans does Steffan have for revenge, if any?
- What would prompt immediate action on Steffan's part?
