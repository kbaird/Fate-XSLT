    <story>
      Owns a secret Black Jade mine under her family's more modest "Wayne Manor".
      Someone has developed an anti-psychotic drug using Black and Green Jade that
      has helped her schizophrenic younger sister. Owns The Blooming Lotus, a drug
      den in the Terminal Strip neighborhood of Kausao City under the pseudonym of
      "Madame Lotus". Relationship w/Jianghu (江湖; lit. "rivers and lakes") is unclear.
      Probably travels in upper crust social circles. Employs Hamza Abu-Talat and Steffan
      Gilios at The Blooming Lotus. Naramel.
      The mining company owned by her family is smaller than any of the big 5 from pg96.
      Speaks Naramel natively, Kaiyu at Junior High student level, and Túyàngan and Aerish
      functionally as a glamorous rich person who's not trying too hard.
