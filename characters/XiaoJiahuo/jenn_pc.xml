    <story>
      Owns a secret Black Jade mine under her family's more modest "Wayne Manor".
      Someone has developed an anti-psychotic drug using Black and Green Jade that
      has helped her schizophrenic younger sister. Owns and operates a drug den in
      Kausao City. Relationship w/Jianghu (江湖; lit. "rivers and lakes") is unclear.
      Probably travels in upper crust social circles, and employs Stephen Gilios as a
      networking toadie / club manager.
      The mining company owned by her family is smaller than any of the big 5 from pg96.
