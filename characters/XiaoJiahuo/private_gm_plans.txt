Private GM Plans

Brian:
  Automaton Engineer/Scholar
    works (with Mike?) at [Droneworks]
      on drones? Other automata?
  OR
  Explorer swashbuckler (Ben Sisko masquerading as his mirror counterpart)

Stephen Gilios (Chris):
  Before Jenn's mansion/club are attacked, hears that someone is interested
    in her psych potion

Courtney:
  Several red herrings for technical problems with the drones
  Some fancy parties, she's expected to attend to show the corp/family flag
  through [Some Method] discovers evidence of coverup

Jenn:
  Someone from [Droneworks] raids her mansion or club for drug used for sister
    turns out it is a slight mod of [Researcher]'s original formula

Mike:
  working on Green & Blue elixirs for psych restoration and resilience,
    told that it's for miners (restoration actually for affected pilots)
  give him some red herring projects as well
  eventually finds files for proposed (Green + Blue + Black) resilience potion,
    vetoed by management as too expensive
    [Researcher] left & took formula

Chen Daiyu (Phil):
  Wuxia martial artist (Ghost Serpent)
  works as domestic staff, making the highty-toighty rounds,
    searching for master's killer
      flawed man who worked with 江湖, remembered w/rose-colored glasses

Setting/Shared:
  Figure out who killed Chen's master
  Series of murders around Kausao City
    All in Lower Middle Class to Middle Class neighborhoods
      (where drone pilots would live)
    Maybe some suspects caught by local Vigilance Committees
      except they're innocent, typical VC frameup of enemies
      one is actually guilty, worked as a drone pilot 3 jobs ago
