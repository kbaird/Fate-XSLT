Private GM Plans

TODO:
  Ask everyone if they're cool with the 3 Kausao City Aspects as written
  Ask people about their nationalities / names, if not set yet
  Ask Jenn/Chris what the name of the club is
  Ask Phil what Chen's master's name was
  Think of a name for a LMC/MMC district (where the murders will start)
  Give each PC a private spotlight to describe their typical day
  NPC actions:
    The drug-induced murders
    Stephen hears that someone is looking for Jenn's option
      then someone raids the the club
    A murder in [District]

Brian:
  Explorer swashbuckler (Ben Sisko masquerading as his mirror counterpart)

Stephen Gilios (Chris):
  Before Jenn's mansion/club are attacked, hears that someone is interested
    in her psych potion

Jenn:
  Someone from [Droneworks] raids her mansion or club for drug used for sister
    turns out it is a slight mod of [Researcher]'s original formula

Mike:
  working on Green & Blue elixirs for psych restoration and resilience,
    told that it's for miners (restoration actually for affected pilots)
  give him some red herring projects as well
  eventually finds files for proposed (Green + Blue + Black) resilience potion,
    vetoed by management as too expensive
    [Researcher] left & took formula

Chen Daiyu (Phil):
  Wuxia martial artist (Ghost Serpent)
  works as domestic staff, making the highty-toighty rounds,
    searching for master's killer
      flawed man who worked with 江湖, remembered w/rose-colored glasses
      Specific 江湖 cell was political/national (like Triads or Mafia)
      Shīfu discovered a conspiracy by either Low Port merchants or
        "Communists" to seize the High Port and was silenced
        (JP99, STotC Indonesia 1951)
        38 Dragons ("Triple Prosperity") crime family or
          People's Front for Rectification of Grievances

"Courtney" NPC (if needed):
  Several red herrings for technical problems with the drones
  Some fancy parties, she's expected to attend to show the corp/family flag
  through [Some Method] discovers evidence of coverup

Setting/Shared:
  Series of murders around Kausao City
    All in Lower Middle Class to Middle Class neighborhoods
      (where drone pilots would live)
    Maybe some suspects caught by local Vigilance Committees
      except they're innocent, typical VC frameup of enemies
      one is actually guilty, worked as a drone pilot 3 jobs ago
