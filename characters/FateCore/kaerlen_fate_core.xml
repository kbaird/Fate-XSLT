    +2 to Rapport when dealing with high society
  </stunt>
    <stunt name="Popular">
    Rapport in place of Contacts if well-liked. Prior justification or spend a Fate Point (see FateCore121).
  </stunt>
    <stunt name="Mishpocha">
    When a House Sivis message station is available, spend a Fate Point to use Resources in place of Contacts, Investigate, Lore or some other
    roll where long-distance assistance from someone higher-ranked in House Sivis could conceivably help. Requires some dramatically suitable delay.

      <events>
981YK: Kaerlen moves to Sharn and starts working as a House Sivis barrister on the staff of Josilian
  Kan d'Tarlian (N Gnome Bard3/Expert3, Sharn53), frequently on behalf of the city's Goblinoids -
  House Sivis elders wanted to establish a presence in Darguun, and Kaerlen is groomed for the role.
  He lived in Highwater, Upper Dura (Sharn37/55), and Josilian's offices are in Clifftop, Upper Dura.
990YK: Kaerlen is sent to Rhukaan Draal, Darguun as planned. His official role is as a minor legal
  advisor to the Lhesh's court, but he also spies.
   </events>
    </phase>
    <phase num="2">
      <events>
995YK: Kaerlen is relocated to Gatherhold, Talenta. Overall, his duties are similar in Talenta to
  what they were in Darguun. While there, he enjoyed the company of a Talenta Hulrar named
  Cyrrinda Errim (N Female Halfling Ranger3) who taught him the Halfling language and whose
  first name means "Beautiful Defender" (Races of The Wild 60). The Hulrar tribe is the 2nd-strongest
  tribe and the strongest voice for Talenta unification beyond the limited confederation preferred by
  the dominant Abramams, and the dissolution favored by social Darwinist and traditionalist "Holy"
  Uldra Sindrekel.
996YK: The Last War ends with the Treaty of Thronehold (996-11-11).
   </events>
    </phase>
    <phase num="3">
      <events>
997YK: Kaerlen served as [Jenn's PC]'s lawyer in Sharn, defending her on murder charges. He was unable to
  obtain an acquital, but was able to get her deported rather than imprisoned or maimed. She was then
  sent back to her home in Freeport on the condition that Kaerlen take responsibility for delivering
  her successfully.
   </events>
    </phase>
  </phase-trio>
  <notes>

997YK: Phase Three, above.

Kaerlen's name means "Good Ruby" (Races of Stone 49). He has a fondness for non-Gnomish women, especially
Talenta Halflings. Not that he's averse to Gnomish women or "tall ladies" at all. He has met few Dwarven
women.

Member of House Sivis (ECS236) and its Speaker's Guild (DrM73), employed as needed for the campaign
in public. Possibly working for House Sivis as an Agent (DrM14).

Sivis members in good standing can use a Message Station for free, and other services at 50% cost.
Sivis families are also prone to giving each other aid - not quite Favored in House, but helpful (DrM72).

Folks Kaerlen knows:
 1) Cyrrinda Errim (N Female Halfling Ranger3), ex-lover, very friendly.
  They might still be together if Kaerlen hadn't had to relocate.
 2) Dinagaera Owbaer, a Korranberg librarian (Female Gnome) - they hooked up a few times, friends.
 3) Corius Corralyn d'Sivis (LN Male Gnome Expert 6, DrM76)
 4) One or more Goblinoids in Sharn, perhaps former clients
 5) Josilian Kan d'Tarlian (Male Gnome, Sharn 53) - former employer in Sharn
 6) Solirion Torralyn d'Sivis (N Male Gnome, Sharn45) - head of the Speaker's Guild in Sharn
 7) Hellien Clamas Clebdecher (LN Female Gnome, Sharn55) - best Gnome tailoress in Highhold, Sharn
  Clebdecher Glamerweave (Sharn55/158) costs 500+ gp and grants a +2 to Diplomacy
 8) Thurik Davandi (LN Male Gnome, Sharn 66) - Upper Menthis city councilor in Sharn, tailor
 9) Some minor courtier(s) in Rhukaan Draal, Darguun
10) Some minor courtier(s) in Gatherhold, Talenta
