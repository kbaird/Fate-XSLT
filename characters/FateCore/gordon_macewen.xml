      You've read hundreds - if not thousands - of books on a wide variety of topics. You can
      spend a Fate Point to use Lore in place of any other skill for one roll or exchange,
      provided you can justify having read about the action you’re attempting. (Once per Scene).

      When it comes to naval battles, you've seen every trick in the book. +2 when actively

        Born in Hamilton, ON, 1793.
        Like any loyal colonial subject of the Queen, Gordon volunteered to defend his home
        from American invasion. He served aboard HMAS Dauntless, which primarily defended
        Canada from invasion in the skies above Lake Ontario. In its final battle, The
        Dauntless successfully held off the USAS Jefferson, which retreated back to Rochester.
        The Dauntless sank, but Gordon (obviously) survived.
