    <description>
      Originally an Iranian-American computer scientist and roboticist from Orange County, CA.
      After contracting a terminal illness, successfully transferred consciousness into a small
      (5ish) cadre of robotic insectoid bodies. Given the economics of micro-electronics
      manufacturing, he's now mostly Chinese.
