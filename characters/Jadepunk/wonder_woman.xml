The Ahlmac have legends of the lands far to the south. Deep in the primordial jungles once
roamed a people strong and peaceful, the Ter Praeta. They respected the land and made proper
sacrifice to both Rapaev and Saivep. But even to such people, war must come. For the Ter Praeta
this came in the form of Teltac, the skin stealers. The Teltac killed the Ter Praeta armies,
the old, the infirm, and even the children. The women were to be enslaved. When the women
saw this they prayed and made sacrifice to the moon goddess Saivep, for salvation. Saivep
took pity on her people and made a way for them. Across the river Marjoa, where none may
go, lies a great island. This is the land of the Ter Praeta. Only women, they are immortal
priestesses and Warriors. So says the stories of the Ahlmac.

These stories are true.
-->
Deep in the rain-forest in the center of the largest river on the planet, lies a hidden
island of only women. Far advanced in the use of Jade and other technologies they have
whiled away the centuries hidden in their home. But the discovery of Jadetech by the
nations of the world has concerned the Council of Priestesses. Man's world is violent and
filled with hate. They decided they must send out a scout, to see what the world would do
with this dangerous technology. Mahni, daughter of the Voice of Saivep, was chosen for
this task. She has only been in the realms of Man for a short while, but Mahni cannot
stand by at all the cruelty and suffering she sees. With her weapons and her voice she has
become a prominent member of The Jianghu, teaching of Truth and of Love, and standing up
to those who would Hate or Deceive.
