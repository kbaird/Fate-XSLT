    <charname>Wei Baatarsai, The Bat</charname>
    <playername>Jacob Possin</playername>
    <story>
Baatarsai was born to the owner of one of the finest Jadetech Engineering firms in all of
Kausao, Wei-Tech Industrial. Over ten percent of all jade in the city was smelted in their
Refineries, and Wei-Tech innovations were used in all forms of Jadetech. Life was good for the
child Baatarsai, until that fateful night. On their way home from the opera his mother and
father were robbed and killed in front of his very eyes. On that day he swore an oath to put a
stop to all crime, so that no one else would ever need go through the pain he had just
suffered.

<!--
Raised by his loyal manservant, Peng An, young Baatarsai set out to accomplish his task. He
trained in martial arts, science, and psychology. In learning he discovered that crime was not
merely a problem, but a symptom of a larger problem. He knew that as a man he could not be what
the city needed. He would need to change the hearts of men, to do this he would need to become
a symbol. Bringing hope to the downtrodden and fear to the criminal element. He became the Bat.
A rumor in the night. A mad god that swooped down upon the guilty and freed the innocent. The
City Watch are often driven to distraction by the graffiti of the bat, written on walls and
buildings throughout the city. None suspect that the benevolent business man Wei Baatarsai is
this creature of the night. He makes sure to appear as an idle son of a rich man, uninterested
in anything but parties and women. Bon Vivant by day, Bat Vigilante by night.
