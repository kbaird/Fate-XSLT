    <story>
The floating city of Kent was a bastion of peace and honor. Rich in white jade mines and a
place of high learning. It was ruled over by the ruling house, Clark. Then came the ambitious
General, Xiao, a mercenary who gathered power wherever he could. In one swift stroke he wiped
out the Clarks and took control of the city. The Lord Clark was able to get his son secreted
away prior to the attack. Now Johnathan lives as an exile in Kausao City. He found an ancient
temple deep beneath the earth and there found the power to stand against Xiao and bullies like
him.

        Jadetech Power Suit. It is revolutionary and beyond what most alchemists are capable of even
        in this age of enlightenment. When in direct sunlight the suit allows the wearer to ride the
        beams of light and a degree of invulnerability. It is a strange mixture of Blue, Red and
        Black jade. Since he first stepped into the sky over Kausao, the rich and the criminal have
        been hunting him. They want, nay need, that suit and will do nearly anything to get it.
