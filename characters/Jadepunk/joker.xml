A little over a year ago bodies began to show up on the riverfront. They seemed unrelated in
all ways, men, women, children, Naramel, Aerish, Kaiyumi, Túyangan, nothing connected them.
Nothing except the method of murder. Every one of the victims had bleached white skin and a
terrible smile on their faces.
<!--
During the first week seventeen bodies were found. Every week since, has had at least three
murders. The pressed dubbed this killer, "The Laughing Man." In the back alleys and along the
riverbanks, the stilt walkers and mudskimmers speak of a devil walking the midnight streets.
Strange shadows and maddened laughter are often heard, though none have ever seen him face to
face. In the last few months, The Laughing Man has begun to taunt the Watch, sending them
pieces of the victims and leaving random seeming notes.

If you walk the nighttime streets of the Riverfront, learn to walk in groups. And pray to
whatever gods will have you. Pray that you never meat the laughing man.
