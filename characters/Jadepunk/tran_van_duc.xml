    <story>
      Đức was part of the unsuccessful resistance against the Túyangan invaders in the neighboring nation of Đại Nam (大南, "Big South").
      He has since relocated, along with a sizeable Đạinamese community, attempting to rebuild in Kausao City, with the eventual dream of
      liberating Đạinam from the Túyangan devils.
      (文 is a very typical male Đạinamese middle name, and the custom is to refer to one by personal name, like Đức).
      I see the Đạinamese community in Kausao as having several parallels to the Tauron community in Caprica City.
      The Browncoat analogy applies more to Đức and some others as individuals.
