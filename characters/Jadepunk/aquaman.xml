    <story>
Python Mining Corporation is always looking for new ways to use jade, and new sources of jade.
twenty years back, someone in the company came to the conclusion that the ocean floor was an
untapped potential source of jade. Several development projects were started to deal with the
issues of mining the ocean floor. The Aquaman Project was one such.

<!--
The goal was to make a human worker able to survive in the ocean for great lengths of time.
They wanted to rebuild men into a slave race of jade miners at the bottom of the sea. The
experiment was both a greater success and a greater failure than they could have anticipated.
Their subject had phenomenal strength and endurance, could breath water, and even some sort of
empathic bond with ocean life. However, they could not break his spirit. One year ago, their
Aquaman destroyed the lab and ran away. Now they hunt him, seeking to take him apart and
rediscover what they lost in his escape.

Arthur has only vague memories of his life before the experiments. He remembers being cold and
hungry a lot. He remembers someone, maybe his mother, getting a large sum of money. He
remembers that he had to leave with the men this lady gave him to. That is all he remembers
from before. 15 years later he escaped. Arthur escaped the constant pain, the constant
experimentation. He escaped into a world he could barely understand. For the last year he has
been on the run from Python Mining, and the mercenaries they have hired to track him down.
During his time in the world he has helped many people. Fishermen and sea captains speak of the
Lord of the Storm Sea, a being of elemental power who brings the creatures of the sea to aid
foundering ships.
-->

Arthur has now arrived in Kausao after hearing of other people like him, the Jianghu. Hunted by
the authorities, he makes his way as a hero of the people. If you need help, and if you can
find him, maybe you can enlist the aid of the Aquaman.

  These tattoos are of an intricate and archaic design. They allow the Aquaman to hold his breath
  indefinitly underwater (or nearly so) and withstand great pressure (the protective feature). They
  also had the side effect of allowing the Aquaman to exert some control over marine animal
  life (this falls under the allies, mechanically, but in fiction this is due to his tattoos) This
  design was the creation of a brilliant Jade Alchemist who died during Arthur's escape. These
  designs are the reason Python Mining is after him with such fervor.
