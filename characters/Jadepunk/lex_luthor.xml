    <story>
The world is full of fools. Fools with power and fools without it. This is the sad truth that
Luthor has had to endure her entire life. She may be the greatest mind humanity has ever
produced. She should rule it, control it. Who else is better qualified? Yet at every step some
fool comes along and blocks her success. First it was money, so she became chief engineer for
the king. Then it was authority, and she was forced to deal with the simpleton Xiao. Now she is
nearing her goal. Complete domination is within her grasp, if only Xiao would cease with his
petty paranoias and conspiracies. There will come a day when he is no longer useful to her.
Perhaps that day is nearer than she initially projected. Soon all the world will be brilliantly
efficient and simple. No longer will the simpletons and fools who lucked into power run things
like their own personal play ground. Soon.
