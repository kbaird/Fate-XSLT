    <story>
Twenty years ago a young popular general of the Tuyangan Army staged an ill fated coups attempt
on the throne. His rebel army was wiped out and he fled the country in disgrace. While he had
lost in his bid for power, General 肖 never gave up on his desire for power. His key to
victory came to him when he arrived in the Kingdom of Kent. Hiring himself out as a mercenary
he met the Lord Clark's chief engineer, Alexis Luthor. She was ambitious and amoral, much like
肖. Over the course of a year he managed to gain her confidence and together they
orchestrated one of the largest coups in recent history.
<!--
Since becoming High Lord of Kent, 肖 has dedicated his life to conquest. His people slave
away in the white jade mines and manufactories, building him a massive war fleet of skyships.
However, despite his successes, 肖 is still haunted by his failure. He lives in fear the the
son of Clark, the true ruler of Kent, will one day return and depose him. this thought keeps
him up nights. He cannot merely kill the man, as then he makes a martyr of him. he must capture
and subjugate this supposed rival. He must. 肖 has sent several teams of bounty hunters after
Johnathan Clark with this in mind. None have returned.
