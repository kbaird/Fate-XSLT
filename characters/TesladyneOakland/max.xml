      Your pockets are full of useful little things. Whenever you need something, you have it,
      provided it’s not something too unusual (like a map to Jimmy Hoffa’s body) or too large
      to fit in a pocket, belt pouch, or backpack. When you say you have something, the GM
      should be likely to agree.

  <notes>
    Still has 1 Minor Milestone (ARRPG225) from rescuing Dmitri.

Nobody in the Oakland office knows (or will, at least, admit to knowing) where
he came from, including Max. Not that this seems to bother him. When the first
members of the new team moved into HQ, he was already living there, surrounded
by junk &amp; half-completed gadgets, having booby-trapped the place to the hilt.
In his spare time, he performs building &amp; equipment maintenance, frequently
ignoring the recommended specifications. He takes delight in a tendency to go
unnoticed until he has something to contribute to the conversation—although
that might not always be the same conversation everyone else is having at the
time. He definitely gets along better with machines than people.
