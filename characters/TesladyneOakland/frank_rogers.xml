    <stunt name="Borrowed Knowledge">
      Pick another character (PC or NPC) who's in the scene with you. You can use
      one of their skills for one roll in this scene, whether it's a skill you
      already have or not. When you do this, pay that character a fate point.

      Armor: 2

    <stunt name="Mind Reader">
      When you use Empathy to create an advantage by discovering another
      character's aspects, you don't need to speak with them and it takes
      virtually no time.
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Not a Threat">
      When you Create an Advantage with Deceive to make yourself as
      non-threatening or unobtrusive as possible, enemies will find other
      targets for as long as that aspect exists. As soon as you successfully
      attack someone, the aspect goes away.
