    And yet another thing! I was contemplating her motivation for coming to Oakland, and since
    I'd been obsessively developing her backstory, I decided that she was born in the Bay Area
    but moved to New York for school. Then she stayed there, even after mark's death, out of
    stubbornness. Her daughter Delancey, however, hated growing up in New York and her mother
    for keeping them there, and as soon as she was old enough, she moved in with her
    grandparents who were living in San Jose. They left Delancey the house, so she still lives
    there, continuing to avoid all of Ina's attempts to make contact with her or her daughter.

    The tl;dr of that is "Wants to reconcile with family"
