      When you're in a situation where you're able to slip away unnoticed,
      you have the option to temporarily drop out of the game altogether.
      If you do, spend a Fate Point to reappear disguised as a faceless NPC
      already in the scene (a security guard, a lab-coated scientist, a
      DELPHI goon, etc.).
    </stunt>
    <stunt name="Not On My Watch">
      Once per scene, you can take stress on behalf of someone you have
      already declared is under your protection.
