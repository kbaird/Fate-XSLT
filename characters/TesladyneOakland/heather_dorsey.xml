    When you're in a situation where you're able to slip away unnoticed,
    you have the option to temporarily drop out of the game altogether.
    If you do, spend a Fate Point to reappear disguised as a faceless NPC
    already in the scene (a security guard, a lab-coated scientist, a
    DELPHI goon, etc.).

  <notes>
  Regardless of what modes you have, if they're all standard modes you get ONE of the following improvements:
  * Specialize one trained skill.
  * Focus one trained skill and specialize one focused skill.
  * Focus three trained skills.

  If one of your modes is Science, also apply ALL of the following improvements:
  * Specialize one trained skill.
  * Focus one trained skill.
  * Specialize one focused skill.

  Probably increase Ecology, Biology within Science
