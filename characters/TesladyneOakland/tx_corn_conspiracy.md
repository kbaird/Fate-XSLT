# Dr. Dinosaur and the Texas Corn Conspiracy


An _Anderson Dylan Midwest_ (ADM)
crop is protested for being “Frankenfood” (the standard anti-GMO paranoid bullshit), but
it is a red herring. Dr. Dinosaur once heard Barack Obama refer to Whole Foods in a speech, and
has added **neurargotic crystals** to non-GMO corn in order to cause **Psychic Brain Reversal**
in our mammal president.

To avoid capture, Dr. Dinosaur has taken over the Lawrence Hall of Science, simultaneously
releasing a squad of *Stegasauri* in the Financial District and/or *Futuresaurus Rex* stomping
across the Bay Bridge.

Dr. Dinosaur is wearing A Fisherman’s Wharf baseball cap and a Golden State Warriors tank top.

Background:
According to the dude at the Middle East Market, there is only one kind of corn sold in
supermarkets, grown at one specific location in Texas, and the reason each ear is only
partially ripe is not that you pick them before they’re fully ripe to ensure sweeter corn, but
because of the GMO origin of the crop.
