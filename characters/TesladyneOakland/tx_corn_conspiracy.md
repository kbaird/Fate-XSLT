# Dr. Dinosaur and the Texas Corn Conspiracy

An _Anderson Dylan Midwest_ (ADM)
crop is protested for being “Frankenfood” (the standard anti-GMO paranoid bullshit), but
it is a red herring. Dr. Dinosaur once heard Barack Obama refer to Whole Foods in a speech, and
has added **neurargotic crystals** to non-GMO corn in order to cause **Psychic Brain Reversal**
in our mammal president.

To avoid capture, Dr. Dinosaur has taken over the Lawrence Hall of Science, simultaneously
releasing a squad of *Stegasauri* in the Financial District and/or *Futuresaurus Rex* stomping
across the Bay Bridge.

Dr. Dinosaur is wearing A Fisherman’s Wharf baseball cap and a Golden State Warriors tank top.

**Background:**
According to the dude at the Middle East Market, there is only one kind of corn sold in
supermarkets, grown at one specific location in Texas, and the reason each ear is only
partially ripe is not that you pick them before they’re fully ripe to ensure sweeter corn, but
because of the GMO origin of the crop.

### Resolution / Rules:

**Challenge** (ARRPG 106)

- Clear squad of _Stegasauri_ in the Financial District
- Capture _Futuresaurus Rex_ from the Bay Bridge
- Re-take the Lawrence Hall of Science from Dr. D

However, each of these may be best represented as a **Contest** (ARRPG 110), or perhaps a
_Jadepunk_ **Duel** (JP 73).

## Aftermath

### Finish the Volume (ARRPG 220)

- Everybody gets a **Minor Milestone** (ARRPG225)
- Everybody gets a **Significant Milestone** (ARRPG226): 1pt, 1 **Experience** Boost
- Erase both **Pressures**; Resolve into a new **Title Aspect** from Volume 1
- Create 2 new **Pressures**

1.  _Shave Some Yaks to Get Back Home_
2.  _Who’s Behind It All?_

However, if there are **Collateral Consequences** (ARRPG 120,227), that can affect the new
**Pressures** and character Aspects.
