  Regardless of what modes you have, if they're all standard modes you get ONE of the following improvements:
  * Specialize one trained skill.
  * Focus one trained skill and specialize one focused skill.
  * Focus three trained skills.

  If one of your modes is Science, also apply ALL of the following improvements:
  * Specialize one trained skill.
  * Focus one trained skill.
  * Specialize one focused skill.

Modes with Athletics or Physique can give your character additional physical stress boxes, while modes with Provoke or Will can give
your character additional mental stress boxes. A mode with one or more of these skills rated at Fair (+2) adds one box, while one
rated at Good (+3) adds two boxes.

If a mode has skills that apply to both types, the bonus boxes can apply to either one. For example, the Action mode has Athletics,
Physique, and Provoke. If you've given it a rating of Good (+3), you could have two more physical stress boxes, two more mental stress
boxes, or one in each.

Bonus stress boxes from your Good (+3) and Fair (+2) modes are cumulative. So if you have Good (+3) Action and Fair (+2) Intrigue, both
of which have the Athletics skill, you can get three more physical stress boxesâ€”two from Action and one from Intrigue.
