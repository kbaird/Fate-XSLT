 <stunts>
  <stunt name="Flyer">
   Use Athletics to fly; ignore all ground-based obstacles when you do.
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Grow the Hive">
   If a human (enough) character is Taken Out by stings, he/she gains (or replaces) a Severe Consequence of
   "Mutating into a Human/Bee Hybrid" that needs to be dealt with narratively (and quickly) before it can be
   recovered from. At a cost: weak against whatever the PCs brainstorm that makes sense.
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Hard to Kill a Swarm of Bees">
   For any attack or advantage to have much effect, it must make sense for it to affect a swarm of bees.
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Healing Factor">
   Once per scene, spend a fate point to reduce one of your consequences by one degree of severity
   (severe to major, major to mild, mild to nothing).
  </stunt>
  <stunt name="Lightning Reflexes">
   In a physical conflict, you always act first. If someone else in the conflict has a stunt that gives
   them the same ability, make an Athletics roll to see who goes first.

<!--
Modes with Athletics or Physique can give your character additional physical stress boxes, while modes with Provoke or Will can give
your character additional mental stress boxes. A mode with one or more of these skills rated at Fair (+2) adds one box, while one
rated at Good (+3) adds two boxes.

If a mode has skills that apply to both types, the bonus boxes can apply to either one. For example, the Action mode has Athletics,
Physique, and Provoke. If you've given it a rating of Good (+3), you could have two more physical stress boxes, two more mental stress
boxes, or one in each.

Bonus stress boxes from your Good (+3) and Fair (+2) modes are cumulative. So if you have Good (+3) Action and Fair (+2) Intrigue, both
of which have the Athletics skill, you can get three more physical stress boxesâ€”two from Action and one from Intrigue.
