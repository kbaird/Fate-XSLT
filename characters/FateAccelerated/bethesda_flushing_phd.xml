      Dr. Flushing is a fellow at the Institute for Gravitical and Electro-Mechanical
      Advancement (IGEMA), and is one IGEMA's lead test engineers and field agents.
      IGEMA is frequently in conflict with agents of various international organizations
      who seek to steal their technology, take over the world, or both.
      Gustav von Stendahl, leader of a shadowy spy agency of uncertain affiliation, is
      frequently a thorn in her side. Dr. Flushing has bright red hair and is never
      without several gadgets, including her helicopter pack.
