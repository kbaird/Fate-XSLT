    <description>
      Brick Accountant from the suburbs of the capital; his insistence on following rules got in the way of their corruption.
      Exiled to Băo Jiāng with the impossible task of reducing graft. Tall and wide, but not fat. Bookish, not brutish.

      Followed by Chen while investigating graft. She secretly aided him illegally, but he's too naive to notice.
      Chén dá yù stole [Jenn's PC]'s statue from the Mother-In-Law's estate sale, which is how Fungible 周 came to possess it.
      Followed around by Hóng Mó, who appreciates having been "rescued" from the Silken Shadows.

    <gadget cost="2" name="Stone Tiger 武術" notes="Careful, Forceful:
Stone Tiger practitioners meld solid defenses and aggressive attacks into an erratic but effective style.
There are few movements in Stone Tiger that are not designed to block a blow or crush an opponent, making
it a disconcerting mix of stillness and savagery. Stone Tigers favor strikes that can be easily and effectively
delivered following a defense, including low kicks, short-ranged punches and open hand claw strikes.">
