      Aggrieved ghost (Spirits, Beasts, and Spells, page 53). Earth Sorceress.
      Often appears in the form of a statuette of her living form.

      Middle-class 3rd wife, married up. Killed by her mother-in-law because she
      wanted her son to have a better 3rd wife.

      The Mother-in-Law's grandchildren gave the statue to Fungible 周 in lieu of back taxes.

notes="Earth sorcery is tied not just to rock and stone but to the hidden places of the earth. Powerful
practitioners of this style of magic can even become as stone to resist damage and weather overwhelming
force, but they lack the flexibility of storm or flash of fire sorcery.

Basic Powers: Earth-bonded are able to find hidden truths—they often say, “The ground cannot
lie.” So long as an earth sorcerer touches the earth, she has an innate sense of everything else connected
to the ground: where people are, which crates are empty and which conceal something heavy, structural
supports and faults in a building, and so forth. This lets the character use Careful/Clever to find clues
others could not. The sorcerer does not know who is standing behind a door or the title and contents of
a book hidden in a locked desk, but she knows that those things are there.">
