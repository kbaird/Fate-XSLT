\opening{For the attention of the most esteemed \textbf{Fungible \textsl{周}} (\textit{Zhōu}),}

I hope this message finds you well and entreat you to consider the request contained within.
Your reputation for honesty and integrity precedes you, and so I find myself asking for your
assistance despite us having never been introduced.

There is a powerful artifact in my possession that I wish to see properly dealt with. This
object is of considerable value, but it also carries a dark destiny. I have shepherded this
item for some years, but it has recently become clear to me that it is no longer safe for me
to keep. I have come to the difficult conclusion that I must pass this responsibility on, and
after much consideration I realize you are the best candidate to either take up this
responsibility personally, or to choose another suitable person to be so entrusted.

If you are agreeable to at least discussing this matter, please find me at my academy. As the
roads have become more lawless of late, I encourage you not to travel alone.

\closing{With Great Respect,}

\end{letter}
