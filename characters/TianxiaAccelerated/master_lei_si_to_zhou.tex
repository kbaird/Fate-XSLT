\opening{For the attention of Fungible Zh≈çu,}

I hope this message finds you well and entreat you to consider the request contained within.
Your reputation for honesty and integrity precedes you, and so I find myself asking for your
assistance, despite our not being personally known to one another.

There is a powerful artifact in my possession that I wish to see properly dealt with. This
object is of considerable value, but it also carries a dark destiny. I have shepherded this
item for some years, but it has recently become clear to me that it is no longer safe for me
to keep. I have come to the difficult conclusion that I must pass this responsibility on, and
after much consideration I realize you are the best candidate to take up this responsibility.

If you are agreeable to at least discussing this matter, please find me at my academy.

\closing{With Respect,}

\end{letter}
