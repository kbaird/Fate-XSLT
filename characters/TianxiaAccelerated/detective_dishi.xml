    <charname>Detective Dishi</charname>
    <playername>Tianxia Accelerated</playername>
    <description>
      Lanky and vaguely awkward looking, Detective Dishi nevertheless might be the greatest force
      for justice in Băo Jiāng. A junior magistrate whose unwillingness to take bribes or look the
      other way when crimes are committed by the wealthy or powerful, this young man has already
      made a lot of enemies. He also has a few friends, a mix of soldiers, merchants, and local
      luminaries who help keep Dishi from catching a dagger in the back. Dishi favors nonlethal
      methods, but when called on to defend himself he wields his iron judge’s pen and reinforced
      fan with skill and enthusiasm.
