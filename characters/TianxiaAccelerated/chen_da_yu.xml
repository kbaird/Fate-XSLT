    <description>
      Following Fungible 周 as he was investigating graft. Secretly aiding him illegally, but he's too naive to notice.
      Stole [Jenn's PC]'s statue from the Mother-In-Law's estate sale, which is how Fungible 周 came to possess it.
      Followed around by Hóng Mó, who appreciates having been "rescued" from the Silken Shadows.

    <gadget cost="2" name="Ghost Serpent 武術" notes="Clever, Quick:
Ghost Serpent practitioners are some of the most elusive, graceful, and unpredictable fighters. Their swift,
smooth strikes slide past defenses to find vital points in an opponent and their subtle shifting dodges and
blocks turn aside blows that seemed would connect. Feints and locks augment these methods and allow the
stylist to control a battle, keeping an opponent from bringing his full power to bear on the Ghost Serpent.
Practitioners favor speed and precision over power, eschewing powerful but slower methods for a flurry
of well-aimed and timed techniques.">
