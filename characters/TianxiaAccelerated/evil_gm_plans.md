# 天下 Accelerated (new name?)

## Major NPCs
- Jenn's PC's Mother-in-Law, now long deceased and in one of the various Hells

## Various Evil GM Plans
- Start with _12 Golden Butchers_
  - Or possibly ["Bearclaw Bandits"](http://www.vigilancepress.com/uncategorized/running-demo-games-of-tianxia-my-approach-part-1/)
- "The Prince" _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 183)
  - combine with other scenario, maybe _Saltmarsh_ or _Blood of the Masters_
  - **Prince Xiǎolóng** can observe the PCs being awesome and possibly save his life
- various _Eureka_ Fantasy plots
- Various adventure seeds: _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 175)
- Doppleganger, like John Rogers' D&D comics

### Băo Jiāng
Think about a guest appearance from **Detective Dishi**

_To Live and Die in Băo Jiāng_ (T:BS&J, pg 164)
- **Princess Ju** visits **Băo Jiāng** with an Imperial Seal; **Forger Bai** wants to copy it

### Culty Goodness
_Blood of the Masters_ (T:BS&J, pg 170)
- The **Shining Vampire Sect** kidnaps several masters in order to drink their blood
  and steal their power
**Evil Cultists** (T:BS&J, pg 156)

### Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (四天王)
**"Wind Warriors"** assisted the rise of the current Dynasty and were then betrayed.

**Empress Wu** imagines the (actually dead) **"Faceless Lord"** is directing her plot to frame
**Detective Dee**.
- Might overlap with _Banestorm_ plot, but could also be a good prep.
- Also has some Doppleganger stuff

### Fragrant Harbor
Conan's _Pit of Kutallu_ (fishmen, cultists)
- could be a prep to _Saltmarsh_

### The various Hells
- _Orpheus_?
- Retrieve a dead master
  - Or consult with **Geomancer Fēng** from _Xuvutruobacaoly_ scenario to establish innocence
- What Angel tried to do in _Reprise_ (2.15): go kill the Senior Partners at home

## Monsters
- Ghost (OA165), Ghoul, Hobgoblin, Ogre Mage, Rakshasa, Yuan-Ti
- Bajang (OA145)
- Bisan (OA147)
- Doc Cu'o'c (OA151)
- Dragons (OA153-162)
- Gaki (OA163)
- Hopping Vampire (OA169)
- Nature Spirit (OA177)
- Tsuno (OA197)
- [Wang-Liang/罔两](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangliang) (OA198)

### The Prince
**Prince Xiǎolóng/小龙**, decent young man who will probably become a good emperor,
but currently stubborn & overconfident (trainers were reluctant to challenge him).
- Sent to do military service at a frontier garrison in **Jiāngzhōu**
- doesn't make sense for **Xuvutruobacaoly** to attempt assassination
  - better to do it at court where he can do illusions more smoothly
- could reveal that the Emperor has grown more erratic in the past several years

#### Stats for Prince Xiǎolóng/小龙
- Use **Ma Wei Sheng**
  - High Concept becomes _Heir Apparent to the Imperial Throne_
  - _Son of the Great General Ma_ becomes _Overconfident and Unchallenged (so far)_

### Silk River
- _Saltmarsh_ is normally coastal, could rework as river pirates
  (or save for **Fragrant Harbor**)

### Tiānqiáo Mountains (天橋山)
- "Red Orcs" from _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 62), "Mines of the Mountain King" (pg 178)
  - High tech Orcs on the border. Classic LE society as written: Cardassia, Darguun, etc.
    - Could be Muslim metaphor, deconstructions of various sorts, etc.
- _Citadel by the Sea_ as a mountain keep/guardpost instead of coastal
- _Ravenloft_
- Maybe _Tsojcanth_ and _Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_

### Xuvutruobacaoly
16 years ago, a demon attacked the Emperor and was killed by the Imperial Guard and
Peerless Master "Jordan Siegebreaker" (**Siegebreaker Jīng/经**).

The "Court Wizard Phocas" (**Geomancer Fēng/风**) was found to be in league with the demon,
and was executed.

#### What really happened:
**Jīng** summoned the demon **Xuvutruobacaoly**,
  intending to rule as Regent after the Emperor was killed
- The demon used an illusion to trick **Jīng** into killing the Emperor
  when he thought he was killing the demon
- The demon now masquerades as the Emperor, and is only a slightly worse ruler
- **Jīng** had **Geomancer Fēng** framed for the plot and executed
  (since **Fēng** would have discovered it) - consult in the Spirit World

If combined with _四天王_, maybe the Emperor's replacing has driven **Empress Wu** insane
from _GURPS Banestorm_ (pg 92)

### Zhōngzhōu (中州) and the Imperial Capital
_Regency Romance_ from _Fate Adversary Toolkit_ (pg 106)

_Xuvutruobacaoly_
