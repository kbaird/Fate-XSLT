# 天下 Accelerated (new name?)

## Various Evil GM Plans
- Start with _12 Golden Butchers_
- various _Eureka_ Fantasy plots
- Monsters from _Oriental Adventures_ 3E
- "The Prince" _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 183)
  - doesn't make sense for **Xuvutruobacaoly** to attempt assassination
    better to do it at court where he can do illusions more smoothly
    could reveal that the Emperor has grown more erratic in the past several years
- Various adventure seeds: _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 175)
- Doppleganger, like John Rogers' D&D comics

### Băo Jiāng
Think about a guest appearance from **Detective Dishi**
_To Live and Die in Băo Jiāng_ (T:BS&J, pg 164)
- Princess Ju visit Băo Jiāng with an Imperial Seal; Forger Bai wants to copy it

### Culty Goodness
_Blood of the Masters_ (T:BS&J, pg 170)
- The **Shining Vampire Sect** kidnaps several masters in order to drink their blood
  and steal their power
**Evil Cultists** (T:BS&J, pg 156)

### Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (四天王)
"Wind Warriors" assisted the rise of the current Dynasty and were then betrayed.
**Empress Wu** imagines the (actually dead) "Faceless Lord" is directing her plot to frame
**Detective Dee**.
Might overlap with _Banestorm_ plot, but could also be a good prep.
Also has some Doppleganger stuff

### Fragrant Harbor
Conan's _Pit of Kutallu_ (fishmen, cultists)
- could be a prep to _Saltmarsh_

### The various Hells
- _Orpheus_?
- Retrieve a dead master
  - Or consult with **Geomancer Fēng** from _Xuvutruobacaoly_ scenario to establish innocence
- What Angel tried to do in _Reprise_ (2.15): go kill the Senior Partners at home

### Silk River
- _Saltmarsh_ is normally coastal, could rework as river pirates
  (or save for **Fragrant Harbor**)

### Tiānqiáo Mountains (天橋山)
- "Red Orcs" from _GURPS Fantasy_ (pg 62)
  - high tech Orcs on the border. Could be Muslim metaphor.
- Maybe _Tsojcanth_ and _Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_
- _Citadel by the Sea_ as a mountain keep/guardpost instead of coastal
- _Ravenloft_

### Xuvutruobacaoly
16 years ago, a demon attacked the Emperor and was killed by the Imperial Guard and
Grand Master "Jordan Siegebreaker" (**Siegebreaker Jīng/经**).
The "Court Wizard Phocas" (**Geomancer Fēng/风**) was found to be in league with the demon,
and was executed.

#### What really happened:
**Jīng** summoned the demon **Xuvutruobacaoly**,
  intending to rule as Regent after the Emperor was killed
- The demon used an illusion to trick **Jīng** into killing the Emperor
  when he thought he was killing the demon
- The demon now masquerades as the Emperor, and is only a slightly worse ruler
- **Jīng** had **Geomancer Fēng** framed for the plot and executed
  (since Fēng would have discovered it)
If combined with _四天王_, maybe the Emperor's replacing has driven **Empress Wu** insane
from _GURPS Banestorm_ (pg 92)

### Zhōngzhōu (中州) and the Imperial Capital
_Regency Romance_ from _Fate Adversary Toolkit_ (pg 106)
