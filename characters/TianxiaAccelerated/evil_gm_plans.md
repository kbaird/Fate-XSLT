# 天下 Accelerated (new name?)

## Various Evil GM Plans
- Start with _12 Golden Butchers_
- Doppleganger, like John Rogers' D&D comics
- various _Eureka_ Fantasy plots

### Băo Jiāng
Think about a guest appearance from **Detective Dishi**
_To Live and Die in Băo Jiāng_ (T:BS&J, pg 164)
- Princess Ju visit Băo Jiāng with an Imperial Seal; Forger Bai wants to copy it

### Culty Goodness
_Blood of the Masters_ (T:BS&J, pg 170)
- The **Shining Vampire Sect** kidnaps several masters in order to drink their blood and steal their power
**Evil Cultists** (T:BS&J, pg 156)

### Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (四天王)
"Wind Warriors" assisted the rise of the current Dynasty and were then betrayed.
**Empress Wu** imagines the (actually dead) "Faceless Lord" is directing her plot to frame **Detective Dee**.
Might overlap with _Banestorm_ plot, but could also be a good prep.
Also has some Doppleganger stuff

### Zhōngzhōu (中州) and the Imperial Capital
- Use the Megalan Emperor plot from _GURPS Banestorm_ (4th ed)
  - If combined with _四天王_, maybe the Emperor's replacing has driven **Empress Wu** insane

### Silk River
- _Saltmarsh_ is normally coastal, could rework as river pirates (or save for **Fragrant Harbor**)

### Tiānqiáo Mountains (天橋山) 
- Maybe _Tsojcanth_ and _Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_
- _Citadel by the Sea_ as a mountain keep/guardpost instead of coastal
- _Ravenloft_

### Fragrant Harbor
Conan's _Pit of Kutallu_ (fishmen, cultists)
- could be a prep to _Saltmarsh_

### The various Hells
- _Orpheus_?
- Retrieve a dead master
- What Angel tried to do in _Reprise_ (2.15): go kill the Senior Partners at home
