<h1>Atomic Robo and The Deadly Disco Komissar</h1>

<h2>Pressures/Game Aspects:</h2>

<li><strong>The Honky Capitalist Pig Establishment</strong></li>
<li><em>Tesladyne</em>'s <strong>Remain Calm and Trust in Science</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In the summer of 1978, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> has been invited
to give a talk at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Planetarium">Hayden Planetarium</a> on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_School_(philosophy)"><em>Physiologoi</em></a>
("Those who discoursed on nature") of Miletus, Ionia in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.
(Given the time period, it's likely that the material will be a partial preview what will soon be
found in the book and TV editions of the Robo Universe's version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage"><em>Cosmos</em></a>.) 
Sagan invites both Robo and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> to attend.
As Sparrow II happens to be visiting Robo at the time, and has <em>A Keen And Inquisitive Mind</em>,
she accompanies Robo as well.</p>

<p>After the talk, Robo invites Carl, Neil, and Sparrow on a tour of Tesladyne's facilities at the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building">Empire State Building</a>.  While there, the
offices are attacked by bog-standard vampires. Robo is surprised, because their vampire dimension
security was tightened after a breach in 1965.</p>

<p>Unless brainstorming declares differently, the team should uncover data suggesting that <em>someone</em>
has sabotaged Tesladyne's security in an attempt to discredit <strong>The Honky Capitalist Pig
Establishment</strong> and optimistic scientific worldviews in general (which Tesladyne represents, and
which support the US' technological base).</p>

<p>Evidence points to <em>Capricorn Rising</em>, a discotheque in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan">Chelsea</a> neighborhood in Manhattan, an
astrologically-inclined parody of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54"><em>Studio 54</em></a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan">Hell's Kitchen</a>. Between the cocaine and
loud dance music, the team should be able to make their way into the private offices upstairs to
confront the <em>Deadly Disco Komissar</em> and the <em>Kung Fu Trucker</em>.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The summer of 1978 allows Robo to have returned to Earth from Mars, and for Neil deGrasse Tyson
to be home in NYC from his undergraduate studies at Harvard University.</p>
