    Speaks English natively, French well enough to function but not well enough to pass as
    a native speaker, and a small smattering of Ottoman Turkish, tightly focused on the
    technical topic of ship navigation.
    Also familiar with the pidgin hand signals common on rheoships (SFoS pg20).

      <events>
        Born in Coote&#8217;s Paradise&#8224;, Province of Upper Canada, 1793 to an urban
        artisan-class family of Scottish immigrants.
      &#160;
      &#160;
        Like any loyal colonial subject, Gordon volunteered to defend his home from
        American invasion in 1812. He served aboard _HMAS Dauntless_, which primarily
        defended Canada in the skies above Lake Ontario. In its final battle, The
        _Dauntless_ successfully prevented the _USAS Richard Henry Lee_ from capturing
        York (now Toronto), forcing it to retreat back to Rochester. _HMAS Dauntless_
        sank, but Gordon (obviously) survived.
      &#160;
      &#160;
        Gordie also participated in the defense of Britain from French forces. I imagine
        he took part in the &#8220;Battle of Sheffield&#8221; in the 1820s or 1830s,
        being taken prisoner by the French Empire&#8217;s forces as they took the city
        and released when the UK was under secure French control.
      &#160;
      &#160;
        I think it&#8217;s more interesting to say that instead of being simply
        anti-French as a result, he has conflicting opinions &#8211; perhaps even
        approving of some of Napoleon&#8217;s more liberal policies.
      &#160;
      &#160;
        &#8224;(Coote&#8217;s Paradise was renamed to Dundas in 1814, and is now part of
        greater Hamilton IRL)
