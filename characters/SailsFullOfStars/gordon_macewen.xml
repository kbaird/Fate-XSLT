        Born in Hamilton, ON, 1793.

        Like any loyal colonial subject of the Queen, Gordon volunteered to defend his home
        from American invasion. He served aboard HMAS Dauntless, which primarily defended
        Canada in the skies above Lake Ontario. In its final battle, The Dauntless successfully
        prevented the USAS Richard Henry Lee from capturing Toronto, forcing it to retreat
        back to Rochester. HMAS Dauntless sank, but Gordon (obviously) survived.

        Gordie also participated in the defense of Britain after Napoleon's success at Waterloo.
        I imagine he took part in the &#8220;Battle of Sheffield&#8221; in the 1820s or 1830s,
        being taken prisoner by the French Empire's forces as they took the city.
        He is anti-French Empire (but not bigoted toward Fench people) to this day.
