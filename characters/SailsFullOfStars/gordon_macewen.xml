    Speaks English natively, French well enough to function but not well enough to pass as a
    native speaker, and a small smattering of Ottoman Turkish, tightly focused on the technical
    topic of ship navigation.

        Born in Hamilton, ON, 1793.

        Like any loyal colonial subject, Gordon volunteered to defend his home from American invasion
        in 1812.  He served aboard _HMAS Dauntless_, which primarily defended Canada in the skies above
        Lake Ontario. In its final battle, The _Dauntless_ successfully prevented the _USAS Richard
        Henry Lee_ from capturing Toronto, forcing it to retreat back to Rochester. _HMAS Dauntless_
        sank, but Gordon (obviously) survived.

        Gordie also participated in the defense of Britain from French forces. I imagine he took
        part in the &#8220;Battle of Sheffield&#8221; in the 1820s or 1830s, being taken prisoner
        by the French Empire&#8216;s forces as they took the city and released when the UK was under
        secure French control.

        I think it&#8216;s more interesting to say that instead of being simply anti-French as a
        result, he has conflicting opinions &#8211; perhaps even approving of some of
        Napoleon&#8216;s more liberal policies.
