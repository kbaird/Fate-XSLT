    <description>
      Lararion is in her sixties, which is late-middle age for an elf. She grew
      up on Verdanteye, and like the rest of her people she has no desire to leave.
      Like the other colonists, she wears simple clothes of natural fibers and
      is in incredible shape; Verdanteye is one of those colonies where folks still
      climb from the forest floor to their treetop homes multiple times a day.
