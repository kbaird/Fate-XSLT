    <name>Deeprunner Flagship, Mining Vessel #22</name>
    <description>
      Like many Deeprunner vessels, #22 is made out of hewn stone.
      It resembles a cross between a ship and an ancient castle. And
      like a castle, itâ€™s meant to discourage attacks; the cargo bays
      might be full of gold or other precious minerals, after all, so
      appearing untouchable is advantageous.
