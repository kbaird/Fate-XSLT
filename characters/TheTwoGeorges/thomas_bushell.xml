    <description>
      Thomas Bushell is a colonel in the Royal American Mounted Police and the
      chief of the RAM's Upper California section. In 1995, he is 48 years old
      and a compact, solidly made man of European descent, with brown hair and
      a mustache.

      In the 1970s, Bushell served as a Lieutenant in the Royal North American
      Army. He served with his fellow Lieutenant Horace Bragg and was assigned
      Staff Sgt. Samuel Stanley as his senior non-com on the border with Nueva
      Espa√±a. Several disputes arose during this period which resulted in
      border skirmishes. In one, Bushell was wounded attempting to rescue one
      of his men who was down. Both were saved by Stanley.

      Lived in the NAU capitol of Victoria for many years. Divorced wife Irene
      after catching her in bed with Sir David Clarke; Irene and David are now
      married. Bushell started drinking. Bragg (now Lt. General and commandant
      of the RAM) reassigned him to head the Upper California section in New
      Liverpool so he could get a fresh start.
