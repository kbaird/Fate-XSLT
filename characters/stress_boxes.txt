Modes with Athletics or Physique can give your character additional physical stress boxes, while modes with Provoke
or Will can give your character additional mental stress boxes. A mode with one or more of these skills rated at Fair
(+2) adds one box, while one rated at Good (+3) adds two boxes.

If a mode has skills that apply to both types, the bonus boxes can apply to either one. For example, the Action mode
has Athletics, Physique, and Provoke. If you've given it a rating of Good (+3), you could have two more physical stress
boxes, two more mental stress boxes, or one in each.

Bonus stress boxes from your Good (+3) and Fair (+2) modes are cumulative. So if you have Good (+3) Action and Fair
(+2) Intrigue, both of which have the Athletics skill, you can get three more physical stress boxes—two from Action
and one from Intrigue.
