    <stunt name="Scent Tracking">
      Your sense of smell is far superior to that of humans. You can track and
      recognise people by scent, and gain a +2 bonus on Investigate and Notice
      rolls related to smell. (FH pg 10)

    <stunt name="Hey! Where'd He Get That Gun?">
      At the start of any combat, Junior is inexplicably armed.

        Rich canid, paid by Dinkley family to stay away from home.
        The Dinkley family owns (among other things) a huge portion of Daedelus Corporation.
        The Dinkleys sponsored the design of Enki, which was crazy illegal due to eschewing
        the Asimov Protocols. Someone is still trying to tie up that loose end.
