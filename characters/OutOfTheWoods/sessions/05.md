# Session5 (2019-01-26), "Have Relations with the Isolationists"
  Plan:
    Work Daedelus in to involve Junior more? (Hitman idea?)
      Pre-compel Junior's "What I Don't Know Might Kill Me"
      use Bors (FH pg 76) as the hitman
      - Red Herring of Bors being chased by Daedelus to help his cover to make friends w/Junior
    Isolationists have a planetary defense system?
    Something to do with Opterans?
    Far Havens Protectorate will only allow Canopy to proceed politically if the Isolationists are on board to some degree
    What do the Isolationists want enough to accept not being left alone?
    Maybe some douche in Canopy is getting Isolationists hooked on Red Lotus (FH24) and the PCs find out?
  Events:
    Relatively small physical separation b/t Canopy and Isolationists (Jenn says English Channel)
    Meeting on the Isle of New Tros b/t the two polities
    Canopians have come over the last 10-20 years, Dafny came as a child ~15 years ago
    Isolationists reached out to Canopy. Why? What does Canopy have that is suddenly of use to them?
      Maybe they assumed that the Opteran ruins would have killed Canopy
      Maybe an Opteran ruin was discovered in their territory and they want Canopy to remove it / deal with it
    Bors contacts Junior, informing him that he needs to watch his back
    Junior took the Stunt to use Notice for Empathy to discover Aspects
      Used it to get 2 boxes on Asst's Trouble
    Enki discovers scans for Canids, Junior goes to hide inside Enki main ship chassis
    Combat
      Junior took a 6-pt Consequence of "Bleeding from the Neck"
      Bors took a 2-pt "Shot in the Arm"
      Bors gets in his ship and gets shot out of the sky by the Canopy military
      Dafny gets Speaker to reluctantly conclude that Canopy is useful to them in dealing with offworlders
      D&D now also has possession of Bors' former ship (probably a Magpie Trader)
      "Things With the Isolationists are Still Unsettled" -> "The Isolationists Won't Block Electorate Status"
    Remaining Mysteries:
      Why did the Isolationists reach out?
      What are the details of the Bors hitman job?
      Who can we get to run for Senate?
