# Session10 (2019-06-22) "Trade relationships, Isolationists, Opterans"
- Combine with 221 "Heavy Cargo"
  - Martial Collegium (FH39) recovered a Vore Singularity Generator (FH49)
  - Wants to hire disposable Licensed Free Agents (FH88) to see how it works
  - Brandon Holger or Pander Batz get the gig (and get crushed)
- Canopy is contacted by the Isolationist Asst. Speaker
- He specifically asks for DND, based on previous interaction
  - Ananda probably also asks for Birgit Simeon (FH75) as Opteran expert
- Beneath the Isolationist City of **Schoonmaak Vuur** (Dutch for "cleansing fire")
  - they found a large Opteran ruin
- They want to export whatever is found
  - They want it gone because it's unclean
  - They're not stupid enough to give it up for free
  - They want Canopy to handle everything, but with themselves taking a big cut
    (essentially leasing mining rights)
  - The biggest issue is that they found a chamber with a suspension bubble holding a live time-frozen Opteran
  - Allude to Vore threat somehow (video recording like **Miranda** from _Serenity_?)
