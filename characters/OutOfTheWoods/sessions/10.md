# Session10 (2019-06-22) "Trade relationships, Isolationists, Opterans"
- Combine with 221 "Heavy Cargo"
  - Martial Collegium (FH39) recovered a Vore Singularity Generator (FH49)
  - Wants to hire disposable Licensed Free Agents (FH88) to see how it works
  - Brandon Holger or Pander Batz get the gig (and get crushed)
- Canopy is contacted by the Isolationist Asst. Speaker
- He specifically asks for DND, based on previous interaction
  - Ananda probably also asks for Birgit Simeon (FH75) as Opteran expert
- Beneath the Isolationist City of **Schoonmaak Vuur** (Dutch for "cleansing fire")
  - they found a large Opteran ruin
- They want to export whatever is found
  - They want it gone because it's unclean
  - They're not stupid enough to give it up for free
  - They want Canopy to handle everything, but with themselves taking a big cut
    (essentially leasing mining rights)
  - The biggest issue is that they found a chamber with a suspension bubble holding a live time-frozen Opteran
  - Allude to Vore threat somehow (video recording like **Miranda** from _Serenity_?)

later
  Eureka 172
    Trade war between Daedelus and Wayfarer's Guild
      (Canopy is too early in the colony stage to have sufficient rivalry yet)
    Medical facility is in Mospel, Scelus (FH72)
    Drug created by captured alien life form (sentient and enslaved?)
    NPCs:
      XXX XXX: whistleblower working for Eugenia?
      "Terence" or local Canopy governor
        equivalent to "Sector Governor" in Eureka writeup
      Set up friend who runs his/her own ship for later use of 176 "Return of the Captain"
        (Brandon Holger? FH77) Spout?
      Set up others for 221 "Heavy Cargo"
        Spout?

Subsequent sessions:
  189 "Digital Stud" [someone] tries to mate Enki w/Shard (or whoever)
  176 (as above)
  179 "Spaceport Feud"
  181 "Blind Friendship" (more or less as written)
  188 "Search and Destroy"
  191 "Test Run" (engine instead of ship)
  192 "Shiny New Toys" (may allow Brian some solo work)
  199 "Cash Crops" (happens to Canopy)

Potential use of Campaign Aspects:
  Canopy needs...
    excuse for being offworld for typical scenarios
  Daedelus Isn't Done
    Hitman after Junior?
    Attempt to re-confiscate Enki
    Blackmail attempt (your AI is an abomination)
