# Session8 (2019-04-26), "Talk to the Strumpets"
  Allejandro, Dieter, Emanuelle, Kirsten, and Ra Leyn are all together in a group at the party
  Dafny chats w/Allejandro using the Ananda connection
  Junior smells "Hate Stink" (one or more of this group doesn't like Canids)
  Junior quite obviously scratches himself to provoke a reaction
    Junior observes Ra Leyn
      reacts negatively (due to racism)
    Dafny observes Allejandro
      reacts negatively (due to racism)
    Enki observes Emanuelle
      reacts negatively (due to lack of etiquette, not racism, but PCs don't know that)
  Junior vs. Ra Leyn
    Does he have influence: yes
    Is neutral about the Wayfarer's Guild tax
    he has some gossip (specifics not yet known)
    Success at Cost: Hilde pissed off that the PCs are talking to "The Strumpets"
      (back down to 4/9 pts of influence)
      Dafny Rapports to rescue back up to 5/9
  SPLIT UP THE PARTY (Junior+Enki vs. Dafny)
    Dafny staying with Allejandro, Dieter, Emanuelle, Kirsten, and Ra Leyn
      Ra Leyn sometimes nervously glances at Emanuelle
      Ra Leyn and Dieter both praise the Canid Tax after Junior leaves, but Dieter's behavior seems "off"
        Dieter keeps using the same phrase in support of the Canid Tax:
          "Canids are thrifty people. They can afford to pay."
          Kirsten reacts with a Keiko O'Brien eyeroll
      Dafny changes the topic to the other taxes
        Dieter has a similar stock phrase those taxes (rote phrases)
          Kirsten has eyerolls for all of them
      Emanuelle does not have a strong reaction to talk of taxes
    Junior+Enki chattin' with Natasha
      Natasha was alone, seems aloof
      Natasha is impressed that Junior has his own robot
        thinks Dieter is a "cuck" or a "soy boy", etc.
        nothing particularly interesting about her opinions of Gero Ba
        is jealous of Emanuelle
        Natasha's interest in wealth is as a vehicle to gain power, not wealth in itself
      Natasha is neutral about the taxes
    Back to Dafny, chattin' with Emanuelle
      Dafny mentions Ar-Ulric's wife
        Creates the Advantage "Play It Cool, Man" on Emanuelle with 2 boxes
        Emanuelle has a fair amount (2 pts) of influence over Gero Ba
          She is personally neutral about the taxes, but has argued for them due to
            being blackmailed about her affair with Ar-Ulric
            Ar-Ulric was visited by "Elise" with video evidence of Emanuelle and Ar-Ulric bangin'
        Dafny makes a decent case that Emanuelle could flee to Canopy
          Emanuelle has some concerns about Dr. Pavrat (Dafny smoothes those over)
          Dafny offers to look into the "Elise" situation:
            "we'll clear up your blackmail problem, maybe you'll vote our way after"
  GET THE PARTY BACK TOGETHER
    Challenge (3 attempts vs 5)
      Junior hacks the internetz with Technical at 6 after some Invokes
      Dafny sifts through data with Bureaucracy at 6 after a re-roll
      Enki parses that data with Investigate at 5
    Results:
      PCs have video footage of "Elise" meeting with Ar-Ulric (the threat)
      PCs have video footage of "Elise" with Law Lord Wasmeier, in which he is not obviously distraught
        Is she blackmailing him?
        Is she doing blackmailing for him?
      Meeting between Elise and Wasmeier occurred after the Law Lords vote on the Wayfarer's Guild tax
    All 3 Law Lords are at the party
    Show the Elise videos to Emanuelle, she does not recognize either person, but believes it
    Show the Elise videos to Ar-Ulric, he confirms Elise's ID, video with Wasmeier pisses him off
      Ar-Ulric makes it clear that if the PCs make his problem go away, he will appreciate it
    Show the Elise videos to Dieter
      Does not recognize Elise in 1st video
      Recognizes Wasmeier in 2nd video
      Puzzled why he's being asked about them at all
    Another Challenge to figure out Dieter's deal
      He keeps saying the same monotone rote phrases about the taxes
      He's been "Bucky"ed
