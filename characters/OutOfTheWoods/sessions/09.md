# Session9 (2019-05-25), "Post-Strumpets"
  PCs have amassed 5/9 influence: 3 for Kalina, 1 each for Hilde and Dr. Pavrat
  Junior+Enki talking to Petra
    Petra likes Dieter, mainly out of support for Kirsten (he's a bit of a milk-drinker)
    Petra confirms that she had mild susicions of the Emanuelle/Ar-Ulric
    Petra suspects much more strongly that Emanuelle is bangin' Gero Ba
    Petra does not have influence
  Dafny talking to Kirsten
    Timetable of Dieter's realization that Canids are dirty: 2 months ago
    Ra Leyn saw Dieter with "Elise" at a bar 2 months ago
  Karl-Heinz Wasmeier at party
    All 3 PCs question Wasmeier while sniffing his butt
    Brian fucked it up for everyone, thanks, Brian
    Kevin giving both true and false info, not saying which source
      What are his general thoughts about the impact of taxes on people?
        Publicly and officially neutral about the taxes.
        Gives the usual politician BS about "nobody likes taxes, but..."
      What are his general thoughts about Ar-Ulric?
        Not close. Wasmeier thinks Ar-Ulric and Reiner Ehrlich might be friends.
      He is definitely hiding something
      Wasmeier smells familiar to Junior (his personal scent rings a bell from way back)
        Daedelus connection. "One of Dad's business friends?"
      Enki checks into Wasmeier's past related to Daedelus and/or Papa Dinkley
        Wasmeier is likely to be a Daedelus operative in their anti-Wayfarer's Guild "Dept. of Dirty Tricks"
    Compel "What I Don't Know Might Kill Me" to have Junior just show Wasmeier the photo of him w/"Elise"
      Seems to have no reaction nor recognize/remember her
  Back to Ar-Ulric
    Asking if he's buddies w/Reiner Ehrlich: Not particularly
  Dr. Pavrat may be helpful in un-hypnotizing Dieter
    Dieter approached 2 months ago at a bar by "Charlotte" ("Elise")
    Flipped Dieter's 1 pt to 6/9
  Enki notices Hunter-Seeker in the hallway
    battle ensues, they smash it
  They can trace it back to Wasmeier after several stages of hacking the intertubez
    PCs have gathered enough evidence to get an investigation started on Wasmeier
  PCs set up a meeting w/Ar-Ulric & Emanuelle
    Dafny Rapports to lock in their support, 3 more pts to 9/9
  Ananda thinks this is a win, obstacle to Canopy recruiting a Senator is now gone
  Dr. Pavrat moves to Canopy with Stefan
  Emanuelle starts over in Canopy as well
  "Those Rednecks Did Alright" -> "Those Rednecks Are Handy to Have Around"
  "Nobody to Run for the First Senate Seat" -> "Campaign Season Begins"
  "Not Enough Skilled Workers; We're Used to Asteroids" -> "A Trickle of Skilled Workers"
  Next session: Trade relationships, Isolationists, Opterans, and/or time hijinks
