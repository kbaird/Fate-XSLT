Out Of The Woods

Current Issue:    Canopy Needs Warm Bodies and Useful Stuff
Impending Issue:  Daedelus Isn't Done

The planet Fathom
  Fathom is a relatively pleasant Garden World
  Jenn imagines their population is so low due to a
  combination of the recency of the founding and the
  distance from Fathom to other worlds.

The Canopy colony
  Civilisation Type:  Frontier World (FH51)
  Designation:        Haven Associate (FH52)
  Population:         Low (300k total)
  Government:         Representative (MJ340) - vaguely Scandinavian
  Societal Dev:       Consensus Redistribution Model (MH341)

Canopy occupies the higher tree levels on a large landmass. A group
of isolationists live on a different landmass, which has Opteran ruins.

NPCs:
  Ananda Taylor:  Dafny's handler within the Canopy government
  Brandon Holger: Licensed Free Agent (FH77)
  XXX XXX:        Speaker for the isolationists also on Fathom
