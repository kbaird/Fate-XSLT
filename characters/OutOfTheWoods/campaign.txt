Out Of The Woods

Current Issue:    Canopy Needs Warm Bodies and Useful Stuff
Impending Issue:  Daedelus Isn't Done

The planet Fathom
  Fathom is a relatively pleasant Garden World

  combination of the recency of the founding and the
  distance from Fathom to other worlds.

  202 "Hive Mind"
    New Barstow - system supplying the space morphine
    New Hoboken - pirate base
    the "Ali Baba" hauling medical drugs hijacked before reaching Fathom (Firefly's "Train Job")
      Pander had no known enemies who could pull that off
      Other unsuspicious-at-the-time disappearances starting to look similar to this
        allows for narrow targeting of location
    The crew files an itinerary and goes to New Barstow to get replacement supplies of space morphine
    Enki goes by New Hoboken and notices a base w/interceptors

      Prof. Ched's ship
    Junior smells both Prof. Ched and Pander in the base

  Finish early, ask what Canopy Aspects they want to flip
    Next session, focus on improving relations with The Isolationists

Session5 (2019-01-26), "Have Relations with the Isolationists"
  Plan:
    Work Daedelus in to involve Junior more? (Hitman idea?)
      Pre-compel Junior's "What I Don't Know Might Kill Me"
      use Bors (FH pg 76) as the hitman
      - Red Herring of Bors being chased by Daedelus to help his cover to make friends w/Junior
    Isolationists have a planetary defense system?
    Something to do with Opterans?
    Far Havens Protectorate will only allow Canopy to proceed politically if the Isolationists are on board to some degree
    What do the Isolationists want enough to accept not being left alone?
    Maybe some douche in Canopy is getting Isolationists hooked on Red Lotus (FH24) and the PCs find out?
  Events:
    Relatively small physical separation b/t Canopy and Isolationists (Jenn says English Channel)
    Meeting on the Isle of New Tros b/t the two polities
    Canopians have come over the last 10-20 years, Dafny came as a child ~15 years ago
    Isolationists reached out to Canopy. Why? What does Canopy have that is suddenly of use to them?
      Maybe they assumed that the Opteran ruins would have killed Canopy
      Maybe an Opteran ruin was discovered in their territory and they want Canopy to remove it / deal with it
    Bors contacts Junior, informing him that he needs to watch his back
    Junior took the Stunt to use Notice for Empathy to discover Aspects
      Used it to get 2 boxes on Asst's Trouble
    Enki discovers scans for Canids, Junior goes to hide inside Enki main ship chassis
    Combat
      Junior took a 6-pt Consequence of "Bleeding from the Neck"
      Bors took a 2-pt "Shot in the Arm"
      Bors gets in his ship and gets shot out of the sky by the Canopy military
      Dafny gets Speaker to reluctantly conclude that Canopy is useful to them in dealing with offworlders
      D&D now also has possession of Bors' former ship (probably a Magpie Trader)
      "Things With the Isolationists are Still Unsettled" -> "The Isolationists Won't Block Electorate Status"
    Remaining Mysteries:
      Why did the Isolationists reach out?
      What are the details of the Bors hitman job?
      Who can we get to run for Senate?

Session6 (2019-02-23), "Find a Senator"
  Rework WFRP "Power Behind the Throne"
  Canopy says have settle tax problem in Astar before finding Senator
  Astar is celebrating founding, having a big party
  Karl-Heinz Wasmeier working for Daedelus instead of Chaos?
  Temple Tax same, more or less
  Dwarf Tax = Canid Tax
  Wizard Tax = Tax on Wayfarer's Guild reps from Sanctum (stir dissent within)
  notes at https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7234810/session-6-2019-02-23

Session7 (2019-03-23), "Find a Senator, Part Deux"
  Talking to Kalina (& Hilde):
    Dafny Creates the Advantage "Junior and Kalina Hooked Up In College" (establishing that Kalina went to Kallistan U)
    Dafny Creates "Kalina Likes Us" with 2 free boxes
    Junior discovers Kalina's Aspect "Not Overly Concerned With the Tax on Those Fleabags"
    The PC's get Kalina's overall positive impressions of Allejandro and Ra Leyn
      and negative toward the aides, and that Gero Ba is banging one of them
    Junior blurts out that an aide is also banging the Bishop (Compel), Kalina & Hilde are quite shocked
    Hilde criticizes the Bishop for not being xenophobic enough, and also hates the aides ("the strumpets")
    Got Kalina and Hilde's thoughts about the other NPCs
    Kalina thinks she might have some personal influence if she tried
    Hilde thinks Siegfried has influence, and the aides don't
    Hilde has no-zero influence
    Kalina has a lot of influence
    Kalina is mildly against the Temple Tax, and seems impressed by the WG reps
    Flipped 1 pt of Kalina's influence on Temple Tax
    Flipped 1 pt of Kalina's influence on Wayfarer's Guild Tax
    Flipped 1 pt of Kalina's influence on Canid Tax
    Flipped Hilde's 1 pt by convincing Dr. Pavrat to take Stefan to Canopy (and getting Gero Ba's OK)
    Flipped Dr. Pavrat's 1 pt on his way out the door
  next session, talk to the strumpets
  flipped 5 pts out of required 9

Session8 (2019-04-26), "Talk to the Strumpets"
  Allejandro, Dieter, Emanuelle, Kirstin, and Ra Leyn are all together in a group at the party
  Dafny chats w/Allejandro using the Ananda connection
  Junior smells "Hate Stink" (one or more of this group doesn't like Canids)
  Junior quite obviously scratches himself to provoke a reaction
    Junior observes Ra Leyn
      reacts negatively (due to racism)
    Dafny observes Allenjandro
      reacts negatively (due to racism)
    Enki observes Emanuelle
      reacts negatively (due to lack of Etiquette, not racism, but PCs don't know that)
  Junior vs. Ra Leyn
    Does he have influence: yes
    Is neutral about the Wayfarer's Guild tax
    he has some gossip (specifics not yet known)
    Success at Cost: Hilde pissed off that the PCs are talking to "The Strumpets" (back down to 4/9 pts of influence)
      Dafny Rapports to rescue back up to 5/9
  SPLIT UP THE PARTY (Junior+Enki vs. Dafny)
    Dafny staying with Allejandro, Dieter, Emanuelle, Kirstin, and Ra Leyn
      Ra Leyn sometimes nervously glances at Emanulle
      Ra Leyn and Dieter both praise the Canid Tax after Junior leaves, but Dieter's behavior seems "off"
        Dieter keeps using the same phrase in support of the Canid Tax: "Canids are thrifty people. They can afford to pay."
          Kirsten reacts with a Keiko O'Brien eyeroll
      Dafny changes the topic to the other taxes
        Dieter has a similar to those taxes (rote phrases)
          Kirsten has eyerolls for all of them
      Emanuelle does not have a strong reaction to talk of taxes
    Junior+Enki chattin' with Natasha
      Natasha was alone, seems aloof
      Natasha is impressed that Junior has his own robot
        thinks Dieter is a "cuck" or a "soy boy", etc.
        nothing particularly interesting about her opinions of Gero Ba
        is jealous of Emanuelle
        Natasha's interest in wealth is as a vehicle to gain power, not wealth in itself
      Natasha is neutral about the taxes
    Back to Dafny, chattin' with Emanuelle
      Dafny mentions Ar-Ulric's wife
        Creates the Advantage "Play It Cool, Man" on Emanuelle with 2 boxes
        Emanuelle has a fair amount (2 pts) of influence over Gero Ba
          She is personally neutral about the taxes, but has argued for them due to
            being blackmailed about her affair with Ar-Ulric
            Ar-Ulric was visited by "Elise" with video evidence of Emanuelle and Ar-Ulric banging
        Dafny makes a decent case that Emanuelle could flee to Canopy
          Emanuelle has some concerns about Dr. Pavrat (Dafny smoothes those over)
          Dafny offers to look into the "Elise" situation:
            "we'll clear up your blackmail problem, maybe you'll vote our way after"
  GET THE PARTY BACK TOGETHER
    Challenge (3 attempts vs 5)
      Junior hacks the internetz with Technical at 6 after some Invokes
      Dafny sifts through data with Bureaucracy at 6 after a re-roll
      Enki parses that data with Investigate at 5
    Results:
      PCs have video footage of "Elise" meeting with Ar-Ulric (the threat)
      PCs have video footage of "Elise" with Law Lord Wasmeier, in which he is not obviously distraught
        Is she blackmailing him?
        Is she doing blackmailing for him?
      Meeting between Elise and Wasmeier occurred after the Law Lords vote on the Wayfarer's Guild tax
    All 3 Law Lords are at the party
    Show the Elise videos to Emanuelle, she does not recognize either people, but believes it
    Show the Elise videos to Ar-Ulric, he confirms Elise's ID, video with Wasmeier pisses him off
      Ar-Ulric makes it clear that if the PCs make his problem go away, he will appreciate it
    Show the Elise videos to Dieter
      Does not recognize Elise in 1st video
      Recognizes Wasmeier in 2nd video
      Puzzled why he's being asked about them at all
    Another Challenge to figure out Dieter's deal
      He keeps saying the same monotone rote phrases about the taxes
      He's been "Bucky"ed

Session9 (2019-05-25), "Post-Strumpets"

later
  Eureka 172
    Trade war between Daedelus and Wayfarer's Guild
      (Canopy is too early in the colony stage to have sufficient rivalry yet)
    Medical facility is in Mospel, Scelus (FH72)
    Drug created by captured alien life form (sentient and enslaved?)
    NPCs:
      XXX XXX: whistleblower working for Eugenia?
      "Terence" or local Canopy governor
        equivalent to "Sector Governor" in Eureka writeup
      Set up friend who runs his/her own ship for later use of 176 "Return of the Captain"
        (Brandon Holger? FH77) Spout?

  191 "Test Run" (engine instead of ship)
  192 "Shiny New Toys" (may allow Brian some solo work)
  199 "Cash Crops" (happens to Canopy)
  221 "Heavy Cargo"

Potential use of Campaign Aspects:
  Canopy needs...
    excuse for being offworld for typical scenarios
  Daedelus Isn't Done
    Hitman after Junior?
    Attempt to re-confiscate Enki
    Blackmail attempt (your AI is an abomination)
