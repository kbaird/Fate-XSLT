          Failed Prototype: Faster planing engine didn't work |
          Expected to abide by the Asimov protocols, but is secretly not bound by them in fact |
          Is actually compelled to obey orders from Dinkleys.

  <notes>
    Non-Asimovian status was unavoidable due to attempt at faster planing drive
      Junior knows this. Dafny does not.
      Junior was a part (not all) of the design team.
      This whole idea was illegal. The rest of the design team was killed.
