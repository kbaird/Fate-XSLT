  <notes>
    Jenn tells me his appearance and recent arrival from Astar is not especially noteworthy 
    in Canopy. He's just an outlier of a tendency already common to the populace. His age cohort
    probably chuckles behind his back that it took him long enough to emigrate from Astar.
    Shares the communitarian outlook common to Canopy and Astar, presumably inspired by the
    demands of Astar's fully artificial enviornment (like Traveller's Glisten).
