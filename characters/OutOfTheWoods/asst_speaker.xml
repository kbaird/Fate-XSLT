      You can invoke your High Concept when the Speaker suffers an attack. When you do, redirect that attack to yourself.
      Your defense is Average (+1) against that attack.

    <stunt name="Okay, Fine!">
      You can use Provoke in place of Empathy to learn a targetâ€™s aspects, by bullying them until they reveal one to you. The target defends
      against this with Will. (If the GM thinks the aspect is particularly vulnerable to your hostile approach, you get a +2 bonus.)
